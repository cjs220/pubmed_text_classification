19683081,This review article focuses on the application of proteomics to the identification of molecular mechanisms leading to the deterioration of blood platelets during storage - a critical aspect in the provision of platelet transfusion products.,,,,,
19683081,Several proteomic approaches have been employed to analyse changes in the platelet protein profile during storage and the obtained data now need to be translated into platelet biochemistry in order to connect the results to platelet function.,,,,,
19683081,Targeted biochemical applications then allow the identification of points for intervention in signal transduction pathways.,,,,,
19683081,"Once validated and placed in a transfusion context, these data will provide further understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to platelet storage lesion.",,,,,
19683081,Future aspects of proteomics in blood banking will aim to make use of protein markers identified for platelet storage lesion development to monitor proteome changes when alterations such as the use of additive solutions or pathogen reduction strategies are put in place in order to improve platelet quality for patients.,,,,,
25948169,"We previously reported a method, termed enzyme-mediated activation of radical sources (EMARS) for analysis of co-clustered molecules with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) fusion proteins expressed in living cells.",,,,,
25948169,This method is featured by radical formation of labeling reagents by HRP.,,,,,
25948169,"In the current study, we have employed another labeling reagent, fluorescein-conjugated tyramide (FT) instead of the original arylazide compounds.",,,,,
25948169,"Although hydrogen peroxide is required for the activation of FT, the labeling efficiency by HRP and the nonspecific reactions by endogenous enzyme(s) have been dramatically improved compared with the original fluorescein arylazide.",,,,,
25948169,This revised EMARS method has enabled visualization of co-clustered molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes with confocal microscopy.,,,,,
25948169,"By using this method, we have found that GPI-anchored proteins, decay accelerating factor (DAF) and Thy-1 are exclusively co-clustered with HRP-DAFGPI and HRP-Thy1GPI, in which GPI attachment signals of DAF and Thy-1 have been connected to HRP, respectively.",,,,,
25948169,"Furthermore, the N-glycosylation types of DAF and Thy-1 have been found to correspond to those of HRP-DAFGPI and HRP-Thy1GPI, respectively.",,,,,
25948169,"These results indicate that each GPI-anchored protein species forms a specific lipid raft depending on its GPI attachment signal, and that the EMARS method can segregate individual lipid rafts.",,,,,
14551218,"Using streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar and GK rats as models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, we investigated the changes in serum and urinary hyaluronidase activity with the pathological progress.",,,,,
14551218,The serum hyaluronidase levels of streptozotocin-induced rats started to increase on the third day after injection and thereafter maintained approximately threefold higher levels compared with control rats, those of GK rats were already higher ( approximately twofold) from the beginning of the experiment.,,,,
14551218,"The increases of serum hyaluronidase activity in both diabetic rats were similar to those of blood glucose level, indicating that diabetes mellitus was accompanied by enhanced activity of circulating hyaluronidase from the early phase of its development.",,,,,
14551218,"In zymography, every serum from diabetic and control rats gave two hyaluronidase isomers, a major 73-kDa band (Hyal-1 type) and a minor 132-kDa band, suggesting that the increases in serum hyaluronidase activity were not due to the appearance of novel isomers.",,,,,
14551218,"The hyaluronidase activity in 24-h urine of streptozotocin-induced rats was 3-, 7-, and 11-fold higher at the 8th, 15th, and 18th week than that of control rats, respectively, and the urinary hyaluronidase activity of GK rats was not significantly different from controls.",,,,,
14551218,There was a good correlation between the urinary hyaluronidase activity and the albumin excretion.,,,,,
14551218,Thus the increase in urinary hyaluronidase activity may reflect enhanced glomerular permeability in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and may be a useful marker for diabetic nephropathy.,,,,,
14551218,Relative resistance to SDS-denaturation in zymography of rat serum and urinary hyaluronidases compared with human serum hyaluronidase are also shown.,,,,,
8195148,"The human hepatitis B virus (HBV) X gene seems to be essential for establishment of viral infection, and the X gene product, HBx, transactivates virus and host genes through a wide variety of cis-elements, whereas regulation of HBx has not been fully understood.",,,,,
8195148,We found that transactivation-negative HBx mutants truncated at the C-terminal portion specifically repressed the HBx transactivation in trans.,,,,,
8195148,The ability to trans-repress the HBx transactivation is confined to the N-terminal third of HBx.,,,,,
8195148,Transactivation-positive constructs of HBx were divided into two groups by their sensitivity to trans-repression due to the presence of the N-terminal third.,,,,,
8195148,"Thus the regulatory domain, the N-terminal third, is separated from the transacting domain and responsible for the negative regulations, the trans-repression and sensitivity to X trans-repression.",,,,,
8195148,A possible direct association between the HBx regulatory domains was tested by far-Western blotting using purified fused forms of HBx proteins.,,,,,
8195148,"The regulatory domain was found to associate preferentially with the full HBx or the regulatory domain, but not with the transacting domain.",,,,,
8195148,"Taken together, it is possible that HBx has a self-regulatory mechanism that avoids excessive HBx transactivation and is important for regulation of X gene expression.",,,,,
11841813,The possible involvement of the starch bound R1 protein from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) in the phosphorylation of starch was investigated by functional expression and characterisation of R1 in Escherichia coli.,,,,,
11841813,"By expression of R1 in E. coli it is shown that it is possible to produce glycopolymers, e.g., glycogen, with an increased degree of phosphate substitution.",,,,,
11841813,The expression of R1 in E. coli resulted in a sixfold increase in glycogen bound phosphate and in an increased accumulation of glycogen leading to a glycogen excess (gex) phenotype.,,,,,
11841813,There was an overall shift in the unit-chain length of the isolated glycogen towards smaller degrees of polymerisation.,,,,,
11841813,"The pleiotropic effects on the glycogen biosynthetic and amylolytic enzyme activities was investigated and showed an increase in ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase activity, as well as a decrease in exo-amylolytic activity.",,,,,

16096344,MGL1/CD301a is a C-type lectin that recognizes galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine as monosaccharides and is expressed on limited populations of macrophages and dendritic cells at least in adult mice.,,,,,
16096344,"In this study, pregnant mice with Mgl1+/- genotype were mated with Mgl1+/- or Mgl1-/- genotype males, and the embryos were used to assess a hypothesis that this molecule plays an important role in the clearance of apoptotic cells.",,,,,
16096344,After X-ray irradiation at 1 Gy of developing embryos at 10.5 days post coitus (d.p.c.,,,,,
16096344,"), the number of Mgl1-/- pups was significantly reduced as compared with Mgl1+/+ pups.",,,,,
16096344,"Distributions of MGL1-positive cells, MGL2-positive cells, and apoptotic cells were histologically examined in irradiated Mgl1+/+ embryos.",,,,,
16096344,"MGL1-positive cells were detected in the neural tube in which many cells undergo apoptosis, whereas MGL2-positive cells were not observed.",,,,,
16096344,Biotinylated recombinant MGL1 bound a significant portion of the apoptotic cells.,,,,,
16096344,"When Mgl1+/+ and Mgl1-/- embryos were examined for the presence of apoptotic cells, similar numbers of apoptotic cells gave rise, but the clearance of these cells was slower in Mgl1-/- embryos than in Mgl1+/+ embryos.",,,,,
16096344,These results strongly suggest that MGL1/CD301a is involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells.,,,,,
16096344,This process should be essential in the repair and normal development of X-ray-irradiated embryos.,,,,,
20340043,"In previous studies protective antibodies that could facilitate bactericidal killing of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) serogroup B strains were derived from immunisation with glycoconjugates prepared from O-deacylated lipopolysaccharide (LPS-OH) via direct reductive amination between the reducing end of the oligosaccharide molecule, created by treatment with alkaline phosphatase, and amino functionalities on the CRM(197) carrier protein.",,,,,
20340043,These glycoconjugates proved difficult to prepare because the presence of amide linked fatty-acyl groups results in glycolipids that are relatively insoluble and aggregate.,,,,,
20340043,"Therefore, we have examined several strategies to prepare glycoconjugates in order to identify a robust, consistently reproducible strategy that produces glycoconjugates with a high loading of LPS derived oligosaccharides.",,,,,
20340043,"Initially we used completely deacylated LPS molecules, but lacking phosphoethanolamine (PEtn) from the core OS as the strong basic conditions required to completely deacylate the LPS would modify the PEtn residue.",,,,,
20340043,"We utilised a squarate linker and conjugated via the reducing end of the carbohydrate antigen following removal of the glycosidic phosphate to amino groups on CRM(197), however carbohydrate loading on the carrier protein was low.",,,,,
20340043,"Glycoconjugates were then produced utilising amidases produced by Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd), which partially remove N-linked fatty acids from the lipid A region of the Nm LPS molecule, which enabled the retention of the PEtn residue.",,,,,
20340043,"LPS-OH was treated with Dd amidase, the reducing glycosidic phosphate removed, and using a cystamine linker strategy, conjugated to the carrier protein.",,,,,
20340043,Carbohydrate loading was somewhat improved but still not high.,,,,,
20340043,"Finally, we have developed a novel conjugation strategy that targets the amino functionality created by the amidase activity as the attachment point.",,,,,
20340043,The amino functionality on the PEtn residue of the inner core was protected via a novel blocking and unblocking strategy with t-butyl oxycarbonyl.,,,,,
20340043,"A maleimide-thiol linker strategy, targeting lysine residues on the carrier protein did not result in high loading of the carbohydrate molecules, however when we targeted the carboxyl residues we have consistently obtained a high loading of carbohydrate antigens per CRM(197), which can be controlled by variation in the amount of activated carbohydrate utilised in the conjugation reaction.",,,,,
8842704,The effect of estrogen on the glycosylation of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was studied in women using oral contraceptives and in male-to-female transsexuals receiving oral or transdermal estrogen treatment.,,,,,
8842704,Oral estrogen treatment induced an increase in degree of branching and a decrease in fucosylation and sialyl Lewis x expression on alpha 1-acid glycoprotein compared to individuals receiving no estrogens or transdermal estrogen treatment.,,,,,
8842704,"The effect on the glycosylation of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was less in the male-to-female transsexuals receiving oral estrogens in combination with cyproterone acetate, a blocker of the androgen receptor with progestagen-like effects.",,,,,
8842704,This was of comparable magnitude as in women using oral contraceptives containing both estrogen and progestagen.,,,,,
8842704,We conclude that oral estrogens have an identical effect on the hepatic glycosylation of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein in both males and females and that progestagen reduces this effect.,,,,,
8842704,These results show that oral estrogens induce an effect on the glycosylation of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein opposite to that induced by inflammation.,,,,,
8842704,"Oral estrogens can therefore modulate the glycosylation dependent inflammatory actions of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, while this is not the case with transdermal estrogens.",,,,,
8842704,"In all likelihood, estrogen receptors on the hepatocyte must play a significant role in the observed effect.",,,,,

24588563,Several of the phosphomotifs matched consensus sequences of kinases that occur in P. infestans but not Arabidopsis.,,,,,
24588563,"In addition, we detected tyrosine phosphopeptides that are potential targets of kinases resembling mammalian tyrosine kinases.",,,,,
24588563,Among the phosphorylated proteins are members of the RXLR and Crinkler effector families.,,,,,
24588563,"The latter are phosphorylated in several life stages and at multiple positions, in sites that are conserved between different members of the Crinkler family.",,,,,
24588563,This indicates that proteins in the Crinkler family have functions beyond their putative role as (necrosis-inducing) effectors.,,,,,
24588563,This phosphoproteomics data will be instrumental for studies on oomycetes and host-oomycete interactions.,,,,,

25331954,Knockdown of PAR2 with siRNA eliminated the anti-apoptotic effect of 2f-LI and increased the sensitivity of HT-29 cells to cytokine-induced apoptosis.,,,,,

28982538,"Moreover, the abundance of differentially expressed LEA proteins increased more in the SH genotype compared with the ZY genotype, and several LEA proteins with significant upregulation only in the SH genotype may contribute to its higher tolerance of drought stress.",,,,,
28982538,221 non-LEA proteins were differentially accumulated in at least one of the SH and ZY genotypes.,,,,,
28982538,They are involved mainly with 12 biological functions and they might explain different drought responses of the two genotypes.,,,,,
28982538,"The differentially expressed LEA and non-LEA proteins may be potential markers of drought tolerance to facilitate wheat breeding, particularly those that were specifically upregulated in the SH genotype, or with opposing expression patterns in the two genotypes.",,,,,
21545112,Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a maturing discipline of biologic research that is experiencing substantial growth.,,,,,
21545112,Instrumentation has steadily improved over time with the advent of faster and more sensitive instruments collecting ever larger data files.,,,,,
21545112,"Consequently, the computational process of matching a peptide fragmentation pattern to its sequence, traditionally accomplished by sequence database searching and more recently also by spectral library searching, has become a bottleneck in many mass spectrometry experiments.",,,,,
21545112,"In both of these methods, the main rate-limiting step is the comparison of an acquired spectrum with all potential matches from a spectral library or sequence database.",,,,,
21545112,This is a highly parallelizable process because the core computational element can be represented as a simple but arithmetically intense multiplication of two vectors.,,,,,
21545112,"In this paper, we present a proof of concept project taking advantage of the massively parallel computing available on graphics processing units (GPUs) to distribute and accelerate the process of spectral assignment using spectral library searching.",,,,,

21619074,"In the present study, we demonstrate that the use of LC-Q-TOF-based metabolome analyses (foodstuff, plasma, urine, and caecal content metabolomes) in mice offer higher order information, including intra- and intercompartment relationships.",,,,,
21619074,"To illustrate this, we performed an intervention study with three different phenolic-rich extracts in mice over 3 weeks.",,,,,
21619074,"Both unsupervised (PCA) and supervised (PLS-DA) multivariate analyses used for pattern recognition revealed marked effects of diet in each compartment (plasma, urine, and caecal contents).",,,,,
21619074,"Specifically, dietary intake of phenolic-rich extract affects pathways such as bile acid and taurine metabolism.",,,,,
21619074,Q-TOF-based metabonomics demonstrated that the number of correlations is higher in caecal contents and urine than in plasma.,,,,,
21619074,"Moreover, intercompartment correlations showed that caecal contents-plasma correlations are the most frequent in mice, followed by plasma-urine ones.",,,,,

10988248,Changes in rat vitronectin were studied during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.,,,,,
10988248,Carbohydrate concentrations of vitronectin decreased to 2/3 of sham-operated rats at 24 h after partial hepatectomy.,,,,,
10988248,"Carbohydrate composition and lectin reactivity indicated that N-glycosylation and sialylation of vitronectin changed markedly after partial hepatectomy, while amino acid composition did not change significantly.",,,,,
10988248,"We previously showed that deN-glycosylation of vitronectin in vitro affects collagen binding among various ligands (Yoneda et al., Biochemistry (1998) 37, 6351-6360).",,,,,
10988248,Vitronectins from partially hepatectomized rats at 24 h were found to exhibit markedly enhanced binding to type I collagen.,,,,,
10988248,The effect of sialylation on collagen binding was further examined using enzymatically deglycosylated vitronectin of nonoperated rats.,,,,,
10988248,"Collagen binding increased by 1.2 times after deN-glycosylation of vitronectin, while it increased more than 2.9 times after desialylation.",,,,,
10988248,"Various glycosyltransferases in liver are known to change after partial hepatectomy, including the attenuation of N-oligosaccharide transferase.",,,,,
10988248,The findings therefore suggest that the collagen binding of vitronectin is modulated by the alteration of peptide glycosylation caused by postoperative physiological changes of glycosyltransferases and that the change may contribute to tissue remodeling processes.,,,,,
21920515,"The three oligosaccharide octyl-S-glycosides Man-α1,6-Man-α1,4-GlcNH(2)-α1,S-Octyl (19), Man-α1,6-(Gal-α1,3)Man-α1,4-GlcNH(2)-α1,S-Octyl (27) and Man-α1,2-Man-α1,6-(Gal-α1,3)Man-α1,4-GlcNH(2)-α1,S-Octyl (37), related to the GPI anchor of Trypanosoma brucei were prepared by a stepwise and block-wise approach from octyl 2-azido-2-deoxy-3,6-di-O-benzyl-1-thio-α-D-glucopyranoside (8) and octyl 2-O-benzoyl-4,6-O-(1,1,3,3-tetraisopropyl-1,3-disiloxane-1,3-diyl)-1-thio-α-D-mannopyransoside (9).",,,,,

16595668,"Two regions displayed decreases in binding affinity when mutated to Ala (Ile(192)-Arg(196) and Asp(204)-Ser(206)), but only one region was sensitive when mutated to chemically similar residues (Ile(192)-Val(201)).",,,,,
16595668,"Homology modeling using acetylcholine-binding protein crystal structures with a variety of different bound ligands suggests there may be distinct movements of Trp(195) and Asp(204) upon ligand binding, indicating that these residues and their immediate neighbors have the ability to interact differently with different ligands.",,,,,
16595668,"The models suggest predominantly lateral movement around Asp(204) and rotational movement around Trp(195), indicating the former is in a more flexible region.",,,,,
16595668,Overall our results are consistent with a flexible 5-HT(3) receptor F-loop with two regions that have specific but distinct roles in ligand binding.,,,,,
15872150,"Polysialic acid (PSA) is thought to attenuate neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) adhesion, thereby facilitating neural cell migration and regeneration.",,,,,
15872150,"Although the expression of PSA has been shown to correlate with the progression of certain tumors such as small cell lung carcinoma, there have been no studies to determine the roles of PSA in gliomas, the most common type of primary brain tumor in humans.",,,,,
15872150,"In this study, we first revealed that among patients with glioma, PSA was detected more frequently in diffuse astrocytoma cells, which spread extensively.",,,,,

15872150,"In those transfected cells, PSA is attached mainly to NCAM-140, whereas the mock-transfected C6 cells express equivalent amounts of PSA-free NCAM-140.",,,,,
15872150,Both PSA negative and positive C6 cell lines exhibited almost identical growth rates measured in vitro.,,,,,
15872150,"However, PSA positive C6 cells exhibited increased invasion to the corpus callosum, where the mock-transfected C6 glioma cells rarely invaded when inoculated into the brain.",,,,,
15872150,"By contrast, the invasion to the corpus callosum by both the mock-transfected and PSA positive C6 cells was observed in NCAM-deficient mice.",,,,,
15872150,"These results combined indicate that PSA facilitates tumor invasion of glioma in the brain, and that NCAM-NCAM interaction is likely attenuated in the PSA-mediated tumor invasion.",,,,,

30544044,"Instead of applying homogeneous catalysis process with conventional inorganic acid catalysts like HCl and HClO4, it was found that heterogeneous catalysis using zeolites could be used for the one-pot synthesis of O-methyl 2,3-O-isopropylidenepentofuranoses directly from d-sugars, MeOH and acetone at mild condition.",,,,,

12652076,"Immunoprecipitation of MUC1 and MUC5AC apomucins gives the direct evidence that FUT1 catalyses the addition of alpha-1,2-fucose to these apomucins, supporting the hypothesis that the pattern of apomucin glycosylation is not only instructed by the mucin primary sequence but also by the set of glycosyltransferases expressed in each specific cell type.",,,,,
21413766,The ephrin and Eph signaling circuit has been reported as deregulated in a number of tumor types including nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).,,,,,
21413766,Here we show that suppression of the ephrin-familly member ephrin B3 decreases NSCLC cell proliferation and has profound effects on cell morphology.,,,,,
21413766,"To reveal which signaling networks ephrin B3 utilize to regulate such effects on growth and morphology, differential regulation of phosphorylated proteins was analyzed in the NSCLC cell line U-1810.",,,,,
21413766,"Using strong cat ion exchange (SCX) and TiO(2)-based fractionation followed by nano-LC and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 1083 unique phosphorylated proteins.",,,,,
21413766,"Out of these, 150 proteins were found only when ephrin B3 is expressed, whereas 66 proteins were found exclusively in U-1810 cells with silenced ephrin B3.",,,,,
21413766,Network analysis of changes in the phosphoproteome with regard to the presence or absence of ephrin B3 expression generated a hypothesis that the site specific phosphorylation on Ser-897 detected on the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor tyrosine kinase class A2 (EphA2) is critical for the survival of NSCLC cells.,,,,,

10089214,We found that human peripheral B and T cells differed in the surface expression of alpha2-6 sialylated type 2 chain glycans.,,,,,
10089214,"In contrast to B cells, T cells expressed only sialoglycans with repeated N-acetyllactosamine (Galss1-4GlcNAc) disaccharides.",,,,,
10089214,"This finding was based on the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies HB6, HB9 (CD24), HD66 (CDw76), FB21, and CRIS4 (CDw76) with the alpha2-6 sialylated model gangliosides IV6NeuAcnLc4Cer (2-6 SPG), VI6NeuAcnLc6Cer (2-6 SnHC), VIII6NeuAcnLc8Cer (2-6 SnOC), and X6NeuAcnLc10Cer (2-6 SnDC).",,,,,
10089214,"We found that, in addition to their common requirement of an alpha2-6 bound terminal sialic acid for binding, the antibodies displayed preferences for the length of the carbohydrate backbones.",,,,,
10089214,"Some of them bound mainly to 2-6 SPG with one N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) unit (HB9, HD66); others preferentially to 2-6 SnHC and 2-6 SnOC, with two and three LacNAc units, respectively (HB6 and FB21); and one of them exclusively to very polar alpha2-6 sialylated type 2 chain antigens (CRIS4) such as to 2-6 SnOC and even more polar gangliosides with three and more LacNAc units.",,,,,
10089214,"These specificities could be correlated with the cellular binding of the antibodies as follows: whereas all antibodies bound to human CD 19 positive peripheral B cells, their reactivity with CD3 positive T cells was either nearly lacking (HD66, HB9), intermediate (about 65%: HB6, FB21) or strongly positive (CRIS4, 95%).",,,,,

2037596,A sea urchin gene-transfer expression system showed that 762 base pairs (bp) of 5'-flanking DNA and 17 bp of 5'-untranslated leader sequence of the LpS1 beta gene were sufficient for correct temporal and spatial expression of reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and lacZ genes in sea urchin embryos.,,,,,
2037596,Deletions at the 5' end to either 511 or 368 bp resulted in a 3-4 fold decrease in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity and disrupted the exclusive activation of the lacZ gene in aboral ectodermal cells.,,,,,
