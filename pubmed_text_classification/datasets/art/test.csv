3,Latex beads were modified with the temperature-responsive polymer poly(-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) and co-modified with biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG).,3
4,PNIPAAm undergoes a hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic transition when the temperature is raised above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) (∼28 °C in the solutions used here).,3

14,"The translation of equivalent strategies to the microfluidic environment has relied on three broad categories of biomolecular immobilization techniques: surface modification of microfluidic channel walls, packing of microfluidic channels with biomolecule-bearing beads, and packing of microfluidic channels with biomolecule-bearing porous slabs.",3
15,A disadvantage which most current microfluidic immobilization systems share is their inherent irreversibility.,3
16,"Once a channel is packed with beads or a monolithic polymer, or a channel surface has been chemically modified, there is no simple way for the device end user to remove or renew the immobilized molecule, or to add a new immobilized molecule.",3
17,"This limits the flexibility of device manufacturing, since each device must be manufactured with a specific immobilized biochemistry for a specific application.",3
18,"It also limits device lifetime, both on the shelf and in use, since biomolecules are often fragile, and non-renewable immobilized molecules will eventually lose activity.",3

20,Microfluidic bioanalytical assays that operate without an immobilized phase have also been demonstrated.,3
21,Such approaches include an assay based on the rate of diffusion of antibody-antigen complexes in solution and a technique for maintaining beads in place in a recirculating flow stream without permanently immobilizing them.,3
22,"The work presented here demonstrates the application of a reversible bead immobilization technique which we have recently described for the immobilization of immunoassay reagents within a microfluidic channel in an on-demand, spatially and temporally controlled, and reversible fashion.",4
23,The digoxin antibody–antigen couple was used as a model competitive immunoassay system to show how temperature-responsive bioanalytical beads can be utilized to couple the capture and release of target analytes for quantitative analysis.,3

31,"PNIPAAm and PEG-b doubly modified beads were incubated 15 minutes with equimolar (relative to immobilized biotin groups) quantities of streptavidin in pH 7.6 phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 50 mM phosphate, 5 mM NaCl).",10
32,"To remove any unbound streptavidin, the beads were centrifuged at 16 600 for 15 minutes at 4 °C.",10
33,The supernatant was removed and the beads were resuspended in pH 7.6 PBS.,10
34,This suspension was vortexed and agitated at 4 °C for 2 hours to assure that no bead aggregates remained.,10
35,Biotinylated anti-digoxin IgG was then loaded onto the beads by adding it to the streptavidin-coated bead suspension at a 20-fold molar excess of streptavidin (assuming streptavidin tetramers bound at a 1 : 1 stoichiometry to biotin moieties in the first step).,10
36,"The bead suspension injected into the microfluidic channel consisted of 0.10 wt% doubly modified b-PEG/PNIPAAm beads loaded with streptavidin and anti-digoxin IgG, 0.40 wt% singly modified PNIPAAm beads, and 2.5 mg mL free PNIPAAm in pH 7.6 PBS.",10
37,"The singly modified PNIPAAm beads and free PNIPAAm were added to decrease the concentration of doubly modified beads required to form a continuous adherent network on the channel walls, and to thereby conserve protein reagents.",10
38,The suspension was degassed by agitation under vacuum for approximately five minutes immediately prior to use.,10
39,Experiments took place in what was described in our previous publication as a “type A” channel.,3
40,"Briefly, the device was constructed from stacked layers of laser-machined PET.",10
41,"It consisted of a primary channel with one input port and one output port, with dimensions of 54 mm × 4 mm (at the widest point in the channel) × 300 µm.",10
42,A small injection channel for introducing smart bead suspension led into the primary channel.,10
43,"Temperature control was accomplished  incorporation of a thin-film Therma-Clear™ heater and a HeaterStat™ electronic feedback controller (both from Minco, Minneapolis, MN).",10
44,"When the heater was activated, the controller maintained the temperature in a 20 mm-long region of the channel between 33 and 37 °C (this range of temperatures reflects the precision of the controller).",10
45,"In experiments, the heater was activated to trigger the bead aggregation caused by hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic PNIPAAm phase transition and later deactivated to reverse that process.",10
46,The assembled device was mounted in a microfluidic manifold incorporating an aluminium pressure plate and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gaskets to seal the input and output ports of the device to polyether ether ketone (PEEK) tubing.,10
47,"Computer-controlled syringe pumps (Kloehn Co., Ltd., Las Vegas, NV) were used to drive the flow through the devices, as described in our previous publication.",10
48,The immunoassay protocol is described schematically in Fig. 1b.,6
49,"Two hundred microlitres of the mixed bead suspension were injected  the bead injection channel, connected by the manifold to a short length of PEEK tubing.",10
50,"After bead injection, this tubing was closed off with a standard HPLC tubing valve, preventing flow through the injection channel.",10
51,The input port of the primary channel was connected to the output of a flow injection valve that allowed the operator to select between two flow sources: a 0.3 mL sample loop and a 1.5 mL sample loop.,10
52,The 1.5 mL sample loop was filled with degassed PBS.,10
53,"The 0.3 mL sample loop contained BODIPY® FL digoxigenin in degassed PBS at a concentration of 2.5 µM mixed with digoxin at a concentration of 0, 1.28, 2.56, or 12.8 µM.",10
54,The heater was activated in the absence of flow for 10 minutes.,10
55,"The pumps were then activated, pushing buffer from the 1.5 mL sample loop through the system at a rate of 20 µL min.",10
56,Fluid flowing through the device was captured at the exit of the manifold output tubing in 50 µL aliquots.,10
57,"After 2.5 minutes of buffer wash, the injection valve was switched to the 0.3 mL sample loop, allowing the labeled digoxigenin/digoxin sample to flow into the device.",10
58,"The valve was switched back to the buffer-containing sample loop after 1.25 minutes, making the volume of the digoxigenin/digoxin sample 25 µL.",10
59,"After allowing the sample to bind and flow-through to be washed out (27.5 minutes after the initiation of flow), the heater was deactivated while the flow was maintained at a constant rate.",10
60,Aliquots were collected for an additional 15 minutes as the aggregated beads dissolved.,10
61,"The output aliquots were then diluted to 500 µL in deionized water and the fluorescence of each sample was measured on a Perkin Elmer LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Instruments, Inc., Shelton, CT), with excitation of the BODIPY fluorophore at 492 nm and emission at 511 nm.",10
62,Experiments were performed in triplicate for each concentration investigated.,10
63,The presence of beads in the output samples introduced a scattering signal in the fluorescence measurements.,10
64,This signal made the measured fluorescence higher than it would be in a sample containing no beads.,10
65,"To correct for this effect, a set of samples containing a range of bead concentrations (determined by the OD of the samples) but no fluorescent species were analyzed in the fluorescence spectrophotometer.",10
66,This analysis yielded a linear relationship between bead concentration and scattered fluorescent signal.,10
67,"For each immunoassay sample, the OD was measured and this linear relationship was used to determine what scattering signal to subtract from the measured fluorescence signal.",10
68,The bioanalytical system described in this study utilizes the temperature-responsive polymer poly(-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) to control the aggregation and “stickiness” of biofunctionalized beads.,3
69,PNIPAAm is a “smart” polymer that undergoes a hydrophilic–hydrophobic phase transition at temperatures above the lower critical solution temperature of approximately 28 °C in aqueous buffer.,3
70,The phase transition is accompanied by aggregation and precipitation of PNIPAAm molecules.,3
71,Several authors have reviewed the application of this property to the fields of biotechnology and biomedicine.,1
72,"We have previously shown that when PNIPAAm-coated latex beads are also modified with a biotin–PEG moiety, they can be used to form a temperature-sensitive microfluidic chromatographic resin capable of separating the biotin-binding protein streptavidin from a flow stream.",1
73,This system has been further developed here to demonstrate its capacity to provide the key elements of an in-channel immunoassay.,9
74,The injectable immunoassay system is described schematically in Fig. 1.,9
75,Fig. 1a is a diagram of the antibody-bearing beads.,6
76,The 100 nm amine-coated polystyrene latex beads were modified using NHS-ester chemistry with two separate species: 11 kDa PNIPAAm and 3.4 kDa biotin-PEG.,3
77,"Approximately 40% of the amine groups on each bead ( 20 000 per bead) were biotinylated, as measured by the 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene) benzoic acid (HABA) assay.",8
78,"Streptavidin was then complexed to the beads, followed by complexation of the biotinylated anti-digoxin IgG to the free streptavidin binding sites.",3
79,The digoxin/digoxigenin antigen system was used as a model for demonstrating the key steps of a competitive immunoassay.,3
80,A schematic of the model protocol is provided in Fig. 1b.,6
81,The stimuli-responsive beads displaying the anti-digoxin antibody (step 1) were heated above the LCST of the grafted PNIPAAm to immobilize the aggregated bead network on the channel surface in the heated region (step 2).,3
82,"Channel temperature control was accomplished using a system that maintained the channel temperature between 33 and 37 °C when activated, as determined by placing a thermocouple in the channel under no-flow conditions.",3
83,"Though the temperature cannot be expected to be uniform throughout the channel, PNIPAAm phase transition occurs over a very narrow temperature range, and the polymer can be expected to be in its hydrophobic phase so long as the local temperature is above ∼28 °C under these buffer conditions.",3
84,"Following heating and wash through of unbound beads (step 3), a sample containing both the target antigen molecule (digoxin) and a fluorescently labeled antigen analog (BODIPY® FL digoxigenin) was flowed through the channel (steps 4 and 5).",3
85,A constant concentration of the labeled digoxigenin was used in all experiments.,3
86,"Since the two species in the sample compete for antibody binding, the amount of labeled digoxigenin that binds depends on the concentration of target digoxin in the sample.",3
87,The concentration of digoxin in a given sample can therefore be determined by tracking the amount of antibody-bound fluorescent digoxigenin.,3
88,"After the sample had been allowed to flow through the channel, the heater was deactivated, lowering the channel temperature below the PNIPAAm LCST and causing the beads to disaggregate and leave with the flow stream (step 6).",3
89,Any antibody-bound digoxin or digoxigenin molecules left the channel with these beads.,3
90,"Throughout this procedure, 50 µL aliquots were collected at the channel output for subsequent fluorescence analysis.",3
91,The successful competitive capture of digoxin and digoxigenin is shown in Fig. 2.,5
92,The fluorescent intensities of the system output fractions are given as fractions of total fluorescence measured over the course of the experiment.,3
93,"The zero point on the -axis corresponds to the initiation of pump-driven flow, after bead aggregation and adhesion had been allowed to take place in the heated channel.",3
94,The initially elevated fluorescence values at the 50 and 100 µL points are due to non-adherent beads being washed out of the channel.,5
95,Previous work has shown that approximately 50% of the thermally immobilized bead suspension adheres to the channel walls under flow conditions.,1
96,"Given the ratio of antibody loading on the beads, this implies that approximately 600 picomoles of antibody are available on the channel surfaces for binding to digoxin/digoxigenin.",5
97,This is approximately a ten-fold excess relative to the total amount of labeled digoxigenin injected.,5
98,The peaks that begin at 250 µL represent unbound BODIPY® FL digoxigenin flowing past the immobilized antibodies and out of the channel.,5
99,"At the 550 µL point, the heater was deactivated, lowering the temperature in the channel and resulting in the dissolution of the adherent bead matrix.",5
100,"The beads were washed out of the channel, along with the bound fractions of digoxin and BODIPY® FL digoxigenin.",5
101,Previous work has shown the process of bead release upon decrease in channel temperature to be near 100% efficient.,1
102,The fluorescence signal from the bound digoxigenin is observed as the peak beginning at the 600 µL point.,5
103,"As digoxin concentration increases, the flowthrough peak at 250 µL becomes larger while the elution peak at 600 µL becomes correspondingly smaller.",8
104,This change is due to digoxin competition with fluorescent digoxigenin for binding to the immobilized antibodies.,5
105,"As less labeled digoxigenin binds the beads, more passes through the channel with the flowthrough peak (labeled A on Fig. 2), and less flows out with the beads in the elution peak (B).",5
106,The errors at each individual point in Fig. 2 make it difficult to distinguish between digoxin concentrations.,5
107,"However, by considering total peak area, varying digoxin concentrations can be easily discriminated, as shown in Fig. 3.",5
108,"The plot in Fig. 3a corresponds to the flowthrough peak, while Fig. 3b corresponds to the elution peak.",8
109,"Peak areas were obtained by simply integrating the peaks shown in Fig. 2, after drawing straight lines between the data points.",3
110,"The flowthrough peak was integrated from the 200 µL point to the 450 µL point, while the elution peak was integrated from the 550 µL point to the 700 µL point.",3
111,"While the 1.28 and 2.56 µM points remain statistically indistinguishable in both plots, the 0 and 12.8 µM points are distinguishable from all other points.",5
112,"In this model device format, concentrations of digoxin as low as 1.28 µM could be reliably determined and varying concentrations of digoxin ranging over an order of magnitude could be distinguished.",5
113,The flowthrough peak data were sufficient to provide the full calibration curve throughout this digoxin concentration range.,5
114,These results demonstrate that this system is capable of reporting the competitive binding and measurement of a target antigen in a format that can conveniently provide a wide range of concentration dependences.,4
115,"Because the fluorescence measurements were made on arbitrary flow-through aliquots (related to the channel dimensions and volumes) that were subsequently diluted to accommodate measurements in a standard benchtop fluorometer, the particular accessible range of digoxin concentrations reported in this study does not represent the intrinsic sensitivity of this system.",4
116,"That sensitivity will ultimately be a function of the device and detection design, and on-chip detection schemes and optical probes that minimize dilution and maximize signal should provide particularly important sensitivity enhancements.",4
117,"Finally, it is important to note that since the process of bead adhesion to the channel wall is not stoichiometric, the amount of immobilized antibody is expected to vary slightly with each trial.",4
118,This imprecision results in the relatively large error bars seen in Fig. 2.,4
119,"However, the data presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that meaningful results can be extracted from this platform even in light of the variations in amount of antibody immobilized.",4
120,The reversible biomolecular immobilization facilitated by this technique allowed for all experiments to be performed in a single device over a period of several weeks with a fresh immobilized antibody substrate for each new experiment.,5
121,"Loading this substrate took only ten minutes, and it was not necessary to remove the device from the fluidic manifold connecting it to the sample delivery system.",3
122,"This platform is completely general in that any molecule that can be biotinylated or otherwise bound to the surface of a latex bead ( enzymes, ligands, oligonucleotides) can be immobilized in microfluidic channels  this technology.",4
123,"Finally, the precise and reversible temperature-responsive nature of the smart polymer gives engineers a novel means of control for microfluidic processes, since the spatial distribution of immobilized molecules in a microfluidic device can be controlled merely by controlling the temperature at various locations in the device.",4

2,"First, simulations have been performed at fixed coupling between the reactive medium and the reservoir, later this control parameter was varied during the simulations resulting in various phenomena.",9
3,"We predicted and monitored for the first time various—dynamically changing—precipitation structures and a spatial hysteresis phenomenon, which is beyond the scope of the Turing instability.",4
4,The dynamics of the reaction is well detectable using specific quantities: the total amount of precipitate and its center of gravity.,4
5,"Detailed investigations of homogeneous chemical systems showed that phenomena like bistability, complex and chaotic oscillations may exist only in open chemical systems, far from thermodynamic equilibrium.",1
6,The appropriate experiments are carried out using a  (CSTR).,1
7,"In 1952, Turing predicted that the diffusion of species may destabilize a homogeneous chemical system producing stationary patterns in a spontaneous way.",1
8,The pioneering work of De Kepper and his coworkers provided for the first time an experimental evidence for the formation of Turing patterns.,1
9,"Up to the last decade, a wide range of spatial or spatiotemporal reaction–diffusion patterns (such as complex Turing patterns, phase waves, autocatalytic chemical fronts, ). have been designed and investigated also in open systems.",1
10,Formation of the precipitation patterns in the wake of diffusion driven chemical fronts has been extensively studied from the end of the 1800’s.,1
11,This is the first chemically designed and controlled spatiotemporal pattern formation.,5
12,"Although the generation of such patterns (called Liesegang patterns) is quite easy, the research on this topic still has a great relevance.",1
13,"In the typical experimental setup, one chemical reagent is uniformly distributed in a gelled medium (called inner electrolyte, ), while the other one (called outer electrolyte, ) diffuses from outside.",3
14,The initial concentration of  is chosen to be much larger than that of . This condition ensures the higher diffusion flux of the outer electrolyte into the gel.,3
15,The coupling of the diffusion and the precipitation reaction between the two chemical components produces a non-soluble precipitate () in the reaction front.,1
16,The distribution of the precipitate is usually non-uniform behind this front.,1
17,"Appearing precipitation zones (Liesegang bands or rings, depending on the geometry of the experimental setup) have several empirical regularities (time,  spacing, and width law), in which some well-measurable quantities are connected with each other.",1
18,"These are , the position of the th band, measured from the junction point of the electrolytes,  the appearance time, and , the width of the th band, respectively.",1
19,The Matalon–Packter law describes the dependence of the spacing coefficient ( = /) on the initial concentration of the inner and outer electrolytes.,1
20,"Recently, a new and more general law has been proposed, which also includes advective dynamics in the reactive medium.",1
21,"For this, two new quantities are introduced: , the total amount of precipitate and , the position of the center of gravity of precipitation system measured from the junction point of the electrolytes.",1
22,"Besides the theoretical derivation, experimental and numerical evidences confirmed the new law, which states that  is linearly proportional to .",1
23,"From the beginning of the last decade, more and more complex precipitation pattern formation scenarios have been studied and discussed.",1
24,Several authors reported that the precipitation process followed by complex formation of precipitate may produce moving Liesegang patterns (“moving” bands) or moving precipitation pulse (precipitation waves).,1
25,"In several papers, deterministic chaotic time oscillation of the total number of bands, effect of an electric field on pattern structure, and crossover from the precipitation waves to moving Liesegang patterns have been investigated.",1
26,These are the recent trends in the study of the precipitation pattern formation phenomena.,1
27,"Das . presented the Liesegang pattern formation in 2D using a gel-ring reactor, in which the two electrolyte solutions were fed from reservoirs: The outer electrolyte was fed continuously from the center, while the inner one from a gel ring outside the reaction medium.",3
28,"Several years ago Bhattacharya . proposed a model, which included a single autocatalytic reaction step followed by nucleation and growth.",1
29,"Based on the fact that a cubic autocatalytic step coupling with CSTR may give rise to Turing patterns, they demonstrated formation of spatially periodic precipitation patterns.",1
30,"In classical experimental setup, the diffusion front of the outer (invading) electrolyte depletes the inner electrolyte from the reactive medium due to the precipitation reaction.",1
31,"The aim of this paper is to provide for the first time a systematic investigation of the regular and moving Liesegang pattern formation in an , where a continuous feeding of the inner electrolyte is allowed.",0
32,"To illustrate our idea, we have chosen the simplest precipitation mechanism (1 : 1 type, ), giving rise to precipitation patterns, according to the reaction(aq) + (aq) → (s),where  and  yield the outer and inner electrolytes, respectively, while  is the precipitation product.",6
33,"In addition, the precipitate reacts with the excess of the outer electrolyte, producing a soluble complex(s) + (aq) → (aq).For simplicity, we supposed that the formed complex  is stable, so the reverse step was neglected.",6
34,Due to the irreversible step the stable complex does not affect dynamically the pattern formation.,6
35,"Therefore, it was supposed that neither the complex nor the precipitate diffuses.",6
36,A sketch of our system appears in Fig. 1 where for a clear visual interpretation we provide a 2-D description.,6
37,"In fact, the thickness of the reactive medium is negligible and therefore, the reaction is described using only horizontal coordinates.",6
38,"The dimensionless governing equations for the reactive medium, coupled with a well-mixed reservoir for the inner electrolyte (open system) in 1-D arewith  and  being the time and length coordinates, respectively.",6
39,"Here , , , and  denote the concentrations (or even density for solid phase) of the outer and inner electrolyte, the complex, and the precipitate, respectively.",6
40,"and  are the diffusion coefficients of the corresponding species, while  is the concentration of the inner electrolyte in the reservoir (CSTR).",6
41,is the reaction rate constant for the complex formation (eqn (2)).,6
42,"is related to the coupling between the reactive medium and CSTR, which maintains a continuous mass flux of the inner electrolyte.",6
43,"is the inverse of the residence time of species in the reactor, which can be accurately controlled by the flow rate.",6
44,"The function Δ(, , ) (will be specified later on) describes the precipitate formation based on Ostwald’s supersaturation theory.",6
45,"Despite its simplicity and generality this concept provides a perspicuous mechanism in many cases, where the precipitation process plays a partial role.",6
46,"The efficiency of the above mentioned precipitation mechanism was tested by simulating the effect of an electric field, stochastic precipitation pattern formation, and also moving Liesegang bands and precipitation waves.",9
47,"The term  in eqns (3), (5) and (6) represents the complex formation rate, whereas ( − ) in eqn (4) describes the coupling between the reactive medium and the reservoir.",6
48,"However, it should be noted that the immobilization of the complex is not a necessary condition for the moving pattern formation.",3
49,"To describe the precipitation formation presented by the simple mechanism (1) we choose the model proposed by Büki ., which is based on the Ostwald’s ion-product supersaturation theory.",6
50,"The precipitation reaction term Δ(,,) is defined as follows: where  is the rate constant of the precipitation reaction (1),  is the nucleation product,  is the solubility product, and  is the Heaviside step function.",6
51,The coefficient  is related to the extent of the supersaturation of the system and influences the intensity of the reaction.,6
52,"Formally,  is calculated using the equation ( − ) ( − ) = . As far as  ≤  we do not need to define it, since the precipitation reaction term in (7) is zero, anyway.",6
53,The precipitation reaction continues at a certain point  until the concentration  in  has reached a threshold .,6
54,Numerical simulations were performed using a “method of lines” technique.,6
55,Discretization of eqns (3)–(6) was carried out on a 1-D equidistant grid applying a second-order finite difference scheme.,6
56,"In this procedure, at any fixed time the functions ,, and  in (3)–(6) are substituted with vectors [(, ), (, ),…,(, )] and similarly for ,  and , respectively, where  are the grid points.",6
57,"The spatial differential operator turns to be a matrix of dimension  ×  and with this, (3)–(6) can be approximated by a system of ordinary differential equations (of size ) with respect to time.",6
58,"This has been solved using a second-order Runge–Kutta method with the following initial conditions:(0,) = (−), (0,) = (), (0,) = (0,) =0.The boundary condition is no flux type both for the inner and the outer electrolyte at the end of the reactive medium.",6
59,"It is Dirichlet type (,0) =  for the outer electrolyte at the junction point of the electrolytes.",6
60,"Although both  and  could be used as control parameters of the system,  was fixed in the simulations.",6
61,This concentration has been chosen to coincide that of the initial concentration of  in the reactive medium.,6
62,"The presented model allows to describe the crossover from Liesegang patterns to precipitation waves using only one parameter: in case of  = 0 regular Liesegang pattern formation, and for  ≠ 0 moving patterns are expected.",6
63,"In all simulations, we used the parameter set  =  = 1.0,  = 0.15,  =0.1,  = 1.0, and  = 50.0.",6
64,"The grid spacing was Δ = 1.0, and the numerical simulations were performed with the time step Δ = 0.01.",6
65,"First, the dependence of pattern structure on the coupling coefficient () has been investigated in the case of regular Liesegang patterns ( = 0), and precipitation wave ( = 10).",9
66,"Obviously, if  = 0 (there is no coupling between the reactive medium and reservoir), then regular Liesegang pattern and precipitation wave evolve, and the final pattern will depend on the particular parameter set.",3
67,"If  ≫ 0, a single precipitation zone develops, starting from the junction point of the electrolytes instead of the (regular or moving) Liesegang patterns, due to the high flux of the inner electrolyte from the reservoir.",3
68,"This extremely high coupling reduces and slightly modifies the purely diffusive profile of the invading (outer) electrolyte . This intensive coupling ensures that the product of the local concentrations is kept above the nucleation product (), therefore, the precipitate is formed continuously.",3
69,"Fig. 2a,b shows the final pattern structure for fixed values of .",8
70,Results of the numerical experiments are in good agreement with the above explanation.,8
71,"In the case of the precipitation waves, increasing  results in a thicker precipitation zone, the final position of which is getting more and more close to the junction point.",5
72,"Increasing  promotes the precipitation reaction, thus reduced concentration of the outer electrolyte puts back the complex formation.",5
73,"In contrast to the case of precipitation waves, we predict regular Liesegang patterns for small values of , and a single precipitation zone for relatively high values of the control parameter.",7
74,The  for the regular Liesegang patterns (even for 1-D or planar ones) states that the position of each band is linearly proportional to the square root of its formation time.,1
75,This is a consequence of the diffusive dynamics of the invading electrolyte.,1
76,"In several cases, modification of the dynamics (including the presence of external electric field, advection field, curvature effect) results in some deviations compared to the time law.",1
77,Fig. 3a presents the evolution of the pattern for various values of .,8
78,"Relatively high coupling hampers the depletion of , therefore, the more intensive precipitate formation reduces the concentration of  in the reactive medium, which leads to the slower evolution of the pattern.",5
79,"Similarly, the center of gravity of the precipitation system () exhibits slower motion in time as depicted in Fig. 3b.",5
80,The total amount of the precipitate  and the center of gravity of the precipitation system  are defined as follows:where  is the length of the 1-D reactive medium.,6
81,"At the same time, the enhanced reaction rate increases the total amount of precipitate (), the evolution of which has been plotted in Fig. 3c.",5
82,Note that increasing the coupling coefficient affects more significantly  than .,8
83,"In this way increasing , dependence of  on  exhibits an accelerating growing rate (Fig. 3d).",5
84,"In the regular 1-D case, in all of the subfigures of Fig. 3 one can observe a linear dependence.",5
85,"Moreover, this linear dependence in Fig. 3d is also valid in the case of an additional advective flux in the system.",5
86,"Up to this time, the control parameter () was fixed at certain values during the numerical experiments.",3
87,Now we will focus on the behavior of the system with the coupling rate between the reactive medium and reservoir being varied on a continuous scale: various time dependences of  have been applied.,9
88,"Accordingly, variation of the total amount of the precipitate () and the center of gravity of the precipitation system () is depicted in Fig. 4 as a function of log .",8
89,"The change of log  was linear on [, ( + 1)] with integer values of .",8
90,"We give the exact time dependence of log  as follows:which allows to illustrate clearly its effect on the distribution of the precipitate, where  is the time period of one cycle.",5
91,"All simulations were started at  = 10, which corresponds to a very weak coupling.",3
92,Increasing  results in an increased amount of the precipitate due to the enhanced mass-flux of the inner electrolyte from the reservoir into the reactive medium.,3
93,The maximum of  is attained at the maximal rate of the coupling ( = 1 in the simulations).,8
94,"Similarly,  is decreasing when the coupling coefficient  is decreased (Fig. 4a).",8
95,One can observe a slightly different behavior of the center of gravity with varying .,8
96,"The position  is an increasing function of  up to a certain coupling coefficient, afterwards,  is decreasing (Fig. 4b).",8
97,"Decreasing  from the maximum to its minimum value,  monotonically increases.",8
98,"At the first stage, when the coupling is weak, a precipitation wave travels in the reactive medium.",5
99,"In the case of higher coupling, the precipitate formation behind the pattern will dominate compared to the precipitate dissolution by complex formation.",4
100,"At the same time, the precipitate formation is stopped in front of the pattern, because the coupling and precipitation reaction behind it reduces the concentration of the invading electrolyte.",4
101,"Therefore,  is shifted backward, however, the total amount of precipitate increases continuously.",4
102,"The complex formation of the precipitate has a more significant role behind the pattern, when the coupling rate is decreased.",5
103,"The same applies to , while  increases.",5
104,"At weak coupling, the precipitation process continues in front of the precipitation wave and the wave evolves further.",4
105,The most interesting scenario observed during the simulations is the  of the pattern.,5
106,"Accordingly, one can observe the hysteresis of the quantities  and  related to the pattern.",5
107,"The time oscillation of  is a trivial consequence of the variation of  in time, but the hysteresis is a unique feature.",5
108,Note that similar hysteresis curves (with different maxima) belong to different time dependent functions of .,5
109,"Hysteresis occurs due to the interaction of the reaction rate (for the precipitation and complex formation), diffusion of the electrolytes, and the coupling rate.",4
110,"When increasing , the dominant process is the precipitate formation behind the pattern due to the high coupling, which reduces the diffusion of the invading electrolyte.",4
111,"When decreasing , the precipitate formation process diminishes behind the pattern, and the evolution of the pattern will be driven by complex formation.",4
112,"This process may be accompanied with the precipitate formation in front of the pattern, if the diffusion profiles of the outer electrolyte are regenerated.",4
113,"In the simulations, we varied  periodically over some periods (Fig. 5).",3
114,"We observed that the values of  corresponding to the maximal and minimal values of  have been increased, compared to those of the first period.",8
115,"An interesting feature (using a given parameter set) of the observed system is that after the first loop, a periodic change of  results in the periodic change of total amount of the precipitate.",5
116,"Analyzing the evolution of  while varying the time dependent  in the same way, a similar behavior of the center of gravity has been found.",5
117,Fig. 6 presents the evolution of the precipitation wave over four periods.,8
118,Position of the front and back section of the wave and the center of gravity exhibit a forced time oscillation according to the change of .,5
119,"Time dependence of the back section of the wave has different dynamics whenever the variation of log  (in time) was linear, while decreasing or increasing this control parameter.",5
120,"Note that the thickness of the precipitation zone is related to the total amount of the precipitate, therefore both of them exhibit the same behavior.",5
121,"In this study, we have investigated the regular and moving precipitation pattern formation in an open system using a CSTR for the coupling of the inner electrolyte between the reactive medium and reservoir.",9
122,"Evolution of patterns in both cases, and the distortion of the existing laws (time and “universal” laws) due to the coupling coefficient have been investigated.",9
123,The coupling of the inner electrolyte between the CSTR and the reactive medium has a great impact on the pattern structure.,5
124,"Variation of the coupling coefficient () during the individual simulations resulted in a unique behavior for the moving precipitation wave phenomenon: the pattern structure and the corresponding characterizing quantities, the total amount of the precipitate () and the center of gravity () have hysteresis.",4
125,This new result is a unique observation on this research field.,4
126,"Compared to the Turing patterns which are stationary ones, the above investigated moving precipitation wave phenomenon in an open system represents dynamic patterns.",4
127,The spatial hysteresis of the Turing patterns has been known for more than one decade.,1
128,"The novel result of our study is that we observed the hysteresis phenomenon in a precipitation system, which qualitatively differs from activator–inhibitor or cubic autocatalytic systems, where Turing patterns have been reported.",4
129,The coming step in our study is to design the experimental setup to validate our new predictions.,4
0,On the accuracy of collisional energy transfer parameters for reaction kinetics applications: detailed evaluation of data from direct experiments,9
1,"It is shown that the spread among the various “direct” experimental 〈Δ〉 data in the literature, so unsatisfactory for their application in chemical kinetics, can be removed consistently.",5
2,Underlying agreement within very small uncertainties is demonstrated for the case of the much studied collisional relaxation of highly vibrationally excited azulene.,5
3,"Benchmark experimental data for the collisional energy transfer of highly vibrationally excited azulene obtained by the method of “kinetically controlled selective ionization (KCSI)” (U. Hold, T. Lenzer, K. Luther and A. C. Symonds, , 2003, , 11 192) are used for a detailed comparison with earlier measurements employing time-resolved ultraviolet absorption (UVA) and infrared fluorescence (IRF).",3
4,The experimental UVA and IRF traces are simulated by convolution of the transient vibrational distributions () during relaxation obtained from KCSI measurements with the respective calibration curves of the UVA and IRF experiments.,3
5,The differences between such simulations and the experimental curves are traced back to non-negligible contributions of azulene self-collisions in the UVA and IRF data.,5
6,Astonishing quantitative agreement is reached when azulene/bath gas mixing ratios of the corresponding UVA/IRF experiments are fully accounted for in the KCSI simulations.,5
7,"The influence of self-collisions is thus quantitatively assessed as an important source of error in addition to the well-known problem of calibration curve uncertainties in UVA and IRF detection as discussed earlier (T. Lenzer, K. Luther, K. Reihs and A. C. Symonds, , 2000, , 4090).",4
8,Collisional energy transfer (CET) is a key process in a large variety of chemical reaction systems.,1
9,"In cases like unimolecular or combination reactions, CET rates directly determine the total rates of the chemical reactions in the so-called “low pressure regime” and define the position of the fall-off range of diminishing pressure dependence at increasing densities.",1
10,The analysis of such pressure dependent reactions or the extrapolation of restricted experimental data in the fall-off range towards limiting low and high pressure values  and  is mostly done on the basis of well known analytical expressions from statistical rate theory.,1
11,"In this approach, CET information is considered only in the form of a single collision efficiency parameter .",1
12,"An approximate analytical expression is mostly used to relate  to 〈Δ〉, the average amount of energy transferred per collision.",1
13,"A more general and better alternative consists in a numerical solution of the energy specific master equation of the reaction system, which needs as input data specific rate constants () for the reactive steps and correspondingly () for inelastic collisions, usually quoted as 〈Δ()〉 = (), with  being the gas kinetic collision number.",1
14,At chemically significant energies such CET data usually correspond to very large amounts of vibrational energy and densities of states.,1
15,Analysis of pressure dependent data on reaction rates or yields from measurements in the fall-off range or under chemical activation conditions was the first method to derive 〈Δ〉 values under such conditions and is still used today.,3
16,"However, the inherent disadvantages of this approach are well known: Due to the relation between  and 〈Δ〉, measurements of  require a much higher precision to achieve the same level of accuracy as a corresponding direct determination of 〈Δ〉.",3
17,"But more important, such data evaluation unavoidably includes the absolute value for a reaction rate in the measured product expression with an unknown error limit or a tacit assumption of quasi-infinite theoretical accuracy.",3
18,The possibilities to clearly assign finer observed effects to either the energy transfer or the reactive properties are severely limited.,3
19,In principle this dilemma was overcome with the advent of direct experiments to measure 〈Δ〉 at chemically relevant energies independent from any knowledge on chemical reaction rates.,3
20,Time-resolved infrared fluorescence (IRF) and “hot” ultraviolet absorption (UVA) became the most important techniques.,3
21,"However, the agreement between various measurements turned out to be much less than might be expected.",3
22,"This is very obvious for some frequently studied molecules, especially toluene and azulene, for which direct CET measurements with various techniques or even with the same have led to sometimes astonishing differences, see  Figs. 1 and 2 and Fig. 22 in  or Fig. 20 in .",3
23,"As all these methods directly rely on the quality of a calibration curve for data evaluation, arguments on  deficiencies in the quality of these reference curves have been exchanged mutually but the issue could not be settled.",3
24,The considerable spread among reported “direct” 〈Δ〉 values has led to a sort of common belief among users of 〈Δ〉 data for chemical kinetics applications that the field of large molecule energy transfer at higher energies is still not really settled.,3
25,"Typically then, averages of the available first moment data are taken in the hope to arrive at what is believed to be the best value.",3
26,And as a consequence 〈Δ〉 values inferred from analysis of  pressure dependent rate constants in the fall-off range are very generously called “reasonable”.,3
27,"Thus the impact hoped from directly measured 〈Δ〉 values has not yet been achieved, namely to define much closer boundaries for the CET part in pressure dependent chemical rate data, with improved resulting possibilities to identify more detail in disagreement between chemical reaction rate models and reality.",2
28,"With the results from a second generation method, the kinetically controlled selective ionization (KCSI) this situation has changed.",3
29,"As the only technique so far available, KCSI can determine complete distributions of CET transition probabilities (′,) even at quasi-continuous densities of states.",3
30,"This is done by monitoring the shape of the time dependent population distributions of highly vibrationally excited molecules, as they relax in the electronic ground state from a high initial energy.",3
31,"The resulting 〈Δ〉 data are of unprecedented accuracy, typically on the order of 2–7%.",3
32,"More important, KCSI data are widely and in favourable cases – like that of azulene treated in this paper – completely independent of external parameters of calibration data.",3
33,Thus they provide a benchmark for reevaluation of earlier direct data.,3
34,"Already in the KCSI paper of toluene relaxation one example was shown, in which drastic discrepancies between an early UVA set of 〈Δ〉 and new KCSI data was completely removed with a reconstruction of the experimental curve from time dependent KCSI population distributions and a very minor change in the most uncertain part of the calibration curve.",3
35,"In this paper we apply a similar detailed analysis to various examples of the deactivation of highly vibrationally excited azulene, which has become a benchmark system for investigations of CET.",0
36,Time-resolved ultraviolet absorption has been applied in several studies.,1
37,"The first experiments reported an almost energy independent 〈Δ〉 for all bath gases, with the exception of excess energies below roughly 10 000 cm.",1
38,Subsequently these studies were extended to other excitation energies.,1
39,"In contrast to the early study, an almost linear energy dependence of the first moment of energy transfer was found, though a leveling-off at the highest energies (about 50 000 cm) could not be ruled out.",1
40,"The most recent measurements, carried out at temperatures ≥373 K for excitation energies <20 000 cm, show the highest signal-to-noise ratio obtained so far in an azulene UVA experiment.",1
41,"An almost linear energy dependence of 〈Δ〉 was found over the whole energy range for all colliders, sometimes with substantial deviations from the earlier UVA data.",1
42,"In addition, a variety of measurements employing time-resolved IR fluorescence exists.",1
43,These data were later reanalyzed with an adjusted calibration curve.,1
44,"This resulted in a substantial change of the original 〈Δ〉 values by 30–50%, depending on the bath gas.",1
45,"We show that the deviations of all measurements in Figs. 1 and 2 from the KCSI curves can be removed within very narrow error limits, with the origins of the apparent deviations identified in agreement with experimental parameters originally given or very reasonable estimates of them.",5
46,It will become clear that the sometimes puzzlingly large differences can be traced back to two main effects: (1) contamination of the available data sets by – at first sight – small amounts of self-collisions and (2) uncertainties of the calibration curves needed for converting the raw UV absorption and IR fluorescence data.,4
47,"By proper accounting for these two effects, we can show that all older measurements for azulene and toluene are in fact in complete agreement with the KCSI benchmark data.",4
48,Disagreements reported on CET for related systems are also highly likely due to self-collision and calibration issues.,4
49,"The primary quantity obtained from UVA and IRF experiments is 〈〈Δ(〈〉)〉〉, which corresponds to a 〈Δ()〉 “bulk averaged” over the normalized vibrational distribution () in the ground electronic state with average energy 〈〉: 〈〈Δ(〈〉)〉〉 = ∫∞0(′)〈Δ(′)〉d′",6
50,"Differences between microcanonical and the respective bulk averaged values of the first moments are however small, as long as one is sufficiently far away from thermal equilibrium.",6
51,"In the discussion of the first moment results, we will therefore only apply the notation 〈Δ〉 for both quantities.",6
52,Comparisons for the bath gases argon and CO can be found in Figs. 1 and 2.,8
53,"A similar plot for the helium case was already shown in Fig. 22 of , which also contains the Lennard-Jones collision numbers required for converting the CET rate constants into the respective moments.",5
54,The first CET experiments on azulene employing the UV absorption technique were carried out by Hippler,1
55,"An almost energy independent 〈Δ〉 was found for all bath gases, except for energies smaller than roughly 10 000 cm, where eventually 〈〈Δ〉〉 = 0 has to be fulfilled in thermal equilibrium (〈〉 = 979 cm for azulene).",1
56,"Later, these experiments were extended to low and high excitation energies.",1
57,It is immediately clear from Figs. 1 and 2 and also Fig. 22 of  that the older UVA data lie considerably higher than the KCSI values over wide energy ranges.,5
58,"Very recently, new high quality UVA results have been obtained for temperatures ≥373 K and excitation energies <20 000 cm.",1
59,"The UVA decay curves showing exceptionally low noise were almost monoexponential, which results in a linear energy dependence of 〈Δ〉 over the whole energy range, due to the fact that the calibration curve in this energy region is practically linear (Fig. 3).",1
60,"For a direct comparison with the KCSI results of  we calculated time-dependent UVA profiles from the KCSI data : () = ∫∞0(,)(〈〉)d a convolution of the (,) distributions from a KCSI master equation analysis with a given UVA calibration curve (〈〉) was used to reconstruct ().",3
61,Such profiles can be directly confronted with the experimental UVA traces.,3
62,All UVA measurements for azulene rely on the empirical calibration data shown in Fig. 3.,3
63,The relationship between the absorption coefficient  and the average internal energy 〈〉 of the azulene molecules was established from thermal experiments in heated gas cells (open circles) or shocktubes (filled circles) and measurements after laser excitation (open squares).,8
64,For energies below 25 000 cm the calibration curve is practically linear and can be well represented by the solid line in Fig. 3 using the expression:,5
65,"At higher energies, the calibration curve levels off and there is experimental evidence that it stays constant at least up to roughly 50 000 cm.",5
66,To describe this behavior we modified the calibration curve given in  by a factor of 2.2 to obtain agreement with the experimental points:,3
67,"Above 31 790 cm, a constant value of  = 17 650 l mol cm was assumed, so that the experimentally observed “saturation behavior” of the absorption coefficient is correctly described (dashed line in Fig. 3).",3
68,"Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the most recent UVA data for the colliders helium, argon and CO with our master equation fits employing the (′,) data from Table IV of .",8
69,Note that the UVA data were recorded at slightly elevated temperatures ( = 373 K) so our fits had to be rescaled by the ratio of the respective KCSI and UVA Lennard-Jones collision numbers.,3
70,The overall fit to the UVA traces is very good.,5
71,"Despite this, there are still visible deviations in the first moment plots, see, , Fig. 2 (and especially also Fig. 22 of .)",5
72,"In Fig. 4(a), the decay of the helium UVA signal is slightly faster than in the KCSI fit.",8
73,"In Fig. 4(c), the very slight differences in the decay of the experimental and simulated UVA signals for CO result in the different slopes of the energy dependence of 〈Δ〉 in Fig. 2.",5
74,"These deviations might be either due to a slight temperature dependence of the energy transfer or remaining uncertainties in the UVA calibration curve, as demonstrated in our earlier study.",4
75,The minor differences for helium can probably be explained by a small contamination of efficient azulene self-collisions in the UVA experiments.,4
76,Note that the experimental UVA (and IRF) traces are most susceptible to self-collision effects in the case of inefficient colliders.,4
77,At this point we would like to comment on the clear deviations of 〈Δ〉 found in older UVA measurements.,1
78,"The argon data of Hippler and Troe in Fig. 1 exceed the KCSI values considerably, as it is also found for other colliders.",8
79,The even larger discrepancy for helium as a collider is documented as Fig. 22 in .,8
80,"In Fig. 5(a) the UVA trace for azulene* + argon is shown, which decays clearly faster than the simulated fit (dashed curve) using the KCSI parameters from Table IV of  employing eqn. (3) as calibration curve.",8
81,"As in the helium case, the argon data seem to be contaminated by a visible amount of azulene self-collisions.",5
82,"Such a contribution of collisions with a second bath gas partner in the mixture can be modeled by adding a second term to our general (′,) expression with a parametric exponent in the argument [eqn. (11) in ]:",6
83,"For the parameters ,  and  we use the optimized values from the KCSI analysis.",6
84,The experimental conditions given in  [(azulene)/ = 0.6%] suggest a value  = 6 × 10 as a reasonable estimate for the contribution of efficient azulene self-collisions.,5
85,From the 〈Δ〉 data in  one can extrapolate that the behavior of azulene as collision partner should be very close to that of CHT.,5
86,"We therefore approximated the azulene parameters ,  and  in the small second term of eqn. (5) by using the CHT values from Table IV of .",6
87,The resulting simulation in Fig. 5(a) now shows good agreement with the original experimental trace.,5
88,"Thus, it is strongly suggested that the UVA trace is contaminated by azulene self-collisions, which have not been considered in the extraction of the UVA 〈Δ〉 values in .",4
89,Fig. 5(b) shows another set of UVA measurements for azulene deactivation by the collider argon from Damm,8
90,Two sets of data are available for excitation at 193 and 248 nm.,8
91,The 248 nm curve was shifted so that the decay of both curves coincide.,3
92,"Such a behavior is expected, because the UVA calibration curve appears to be essentially flat for energies above 30 000 cm (Fig. 3).",5
93,Therefore the signal at 193 nm excitation shows an additional constant portion at early times before showing the same decay as the 248 nm signal.,5
94,"Again we tried to fit the UVA traces using our KCSI parameters, but this time employing eqn. (4) (with the aforementioned constant extension at high energies), which should be valid up to excess energies around 50 000 cm.",6
95,The results are also included in Fig. 5(b) (dashed and dotted curves).,8
96,"While the early part of the traces are very well reproduced, there are deviations at longer times.",5
97,The UVA traces decay faster.,8
98,This is consistent with the slightly higher –〈Δ〉 at lower energies already seen in Fig. 1.,5
99,"Again, an influence of self-collisions is very likely.",4
100,In these UVA measurements the self-collision contributions were smaller [(azulene)/ = 0.12%].,5
101,"Nevertheless, including a second term in our (′,) to account for this ( = 1.2 × 10 and CHT parameters for azulene as above) leads to a simulation with better agreement (solid line).",5
102,"One can therefore conclude that the existing body of UVA data is in full agreement with the KCSI results, and the differences observed are due to self-collisions in the older measurements and possibly remaining uncertainties in the UVA calibration curve.",4
103,"The issue of calibration curves was already discussed at length in our earlier publication for toluene, where the seemingly very large discrepancies between the UVA and KCSI results could be quantitatively traced back to small uncertainties in the high energy portion of the UVA calibration curve.",1
104,An extended set of time-resolved IR fluorescence measurements for azulene was obtained by Barker and co-workers.,1
105,These data were later reanalyzed by the same group employing an “improved calibration curve”.,1
106,Their reevaluation changed the original 〈Δ〉 by up to 50% and yielded values at the energies 〈〉 = 13 943 and 24 023 cm.,1
107,"The results for argon and CO of  are included in Figs. 1 and 2 as dotted curves, including a linear interpolation for the reevaluated curve.",8
108,"Similar to the KCSI results, the IRF measurements predict a linear energy dependence of 〈Δ〉.",5
109,"However, the IRF –〈Δ〉 curves are much higher than the corresponding one from KCSI.",5
110,"To analyze these differences, we again take the “direct” approach by comparing our master equation results with the IRF trace for azulene + argon given in .",3
111,This is done in Fig. 6.,3
112,Experimental calibration points and a calculated calibration curve relating the IRF emission intensity and the energy  of the azulene molecules were given in .,1
113,For our simulations we fitted the calibration curve by a fifth order polynomial:,6
114,"The time-dependent IRF simulations employing KCSI (,) can then be obtained : () = ∫∞0(,)()d",6
115,"Note that in the IRF experiments the fraction of azulene molecules was roughly 10%, and therefore much higher than in the UVA measurements discussed above.",3
116,"For that reason, measurements at different argon partial pressures together with a “linear mixing rule” approach had to be applied in  to extract values for pure argon conditions.",3
117,"Not surprisingly, our KCSI master equation fit in Fig. 6 using eqn. (5) and the argon parameters from  decays much slower (dashed line).",8
118,However – like for the UVA data in the preceeding section – perfect agreement is obtained when taking contributions of azulene-azulene collisions into account (solid line).,5
119,"One can only speculate, why we obtain agreement between the IRF signal and our master equation simulation in Fig. 6, when at the same time in Fig. 1 the 〈Δ〉 curves taken from  show strong deviations.",5
120,"One possible explanation might be that the “linear mixing rule” procedure employed in  for different azulene/argon mixing ratios introduces considerable uncertainties when extrapolating to pure argon conditions, greatly affecting the accuracy of the 〈Δ〉 curves.",4
121,We have demonstrated that the body of considerably varying data on 〈Δ〉 in azulene reported in the literature is in an astonishing complete agreement with the more recent “self-calibrating” KCSI data if reanalyzed properly.,5
122,Analogous findings have been reported earlier for the CET of toluene.,1
123,"Together this indicates that a recommended preference of the precision 〈Δ〉 data from KCSI marks a decisive step in defining strict, low error boundary conditions for the application in chemical reaction kinetics.",4
124,"Deviations and spread in reported 〈Δ〉 values from UVA and IRF reported in earlier studies (see Figs. 1 and 2 and ) are most probably due to the following two systematic errors in the UVA and IRF experiments, namely (1) contributions of efficient azulene self-collisions which were not correctly accounted for and (2) unavoidable uncertainties in the UVA and IRF calibration curves.",4
125,"The second point can have drastic effects, as we have already shown in detail for toluene in .",4
126,We believe that similar deviations between the results of different CET methods for other systems are mainly due to the same two effects.,4
127,"The following advice for using large molecule CET data for kinetic applications can therefore be given: If available, KCSI data should be used, as they have the highest accuracy and can be – like in the azulene case presented here and in  – independent of any external calibration.",4
128,Simply taking an average of several available measurements from different sources cannot be recommended in the light of the above discussion.,4
129,"Experiments using high partial pressures of the parent molecule should be checked for the contribution of self-collisions, and corrected accordingly.",4
130,"If possible, one should also assess the accuracy of the calibration curves used, as this can introduce a substantial source of error.",4
0,Statistical mechanical approach to competitive binding of metal ions to multi-center receptors,9
1,A microscopic site binding model to treat binding of several metal ions to multi-center receptors is proposed.,7
2,The model introduces the appropriate parameterization in terms of microscopic complexation constants and metal–metal pair interaction energies.,7
3,"The model is solved with statistical mechanical techniques, including direct enumeration or transfer matrices.",3
4,"We obtain microscopic and macroscopic complexation constants, microstate probabilities, and binding isotherms for chain-like receptors, including the long-chain limit.",5
5,Various examples to illustrate the usefulness of the model are given.,5
6,Interactions of metal ions with ligands represent an important topic in coordination chemistry.,1
7,"In the past, research mainly focussed on mono-center complexes containing a single metal ion and one or more ligands.",1
8,"More recently, attention shifted toward supramolecular multi-center assemblies, which result from the interactions between several ligands and metal ions.",1
9,"Researchers have focussed on the preparation and structural characterization of sophisticated metallo-supramolecular architectures, which can be obtained in high-yield by the simple mixing of the various components (, self-assembly).",1
10,"However, the thermodynamic basis of the formation mechanisms of such complexes is poorly understood, and has not been addressed in much detail so far.",1
11,"Proper understanding of these processes is essential for stimulating molecular programming, and for switching from the usual deductive chemical approach toward induction.",2
12,The latter bottom-up process necessitates an exploitation and modelling of the experimental kinetic and thermodynamic data on complexation reactions.,1
13,"In this context, multi-metal supramolecular lanthanide complexes are particularly interesting, as the search for new receptors displaying selective binding along the 4f-block series provides a substantial database of macroscopic and microscopic stability constants.",1
14,The recent design of heterometallic f–f′ complexes evidencing large deviations from statistical distributions in solution demonstrates the need for mathematical models of multi-center complexation processes.,1
15,The partial rationalization of the formation of the heterobimetallic and trimetallic complexes represents a first step toward this goal.,1
16,"Examples of such complexes are shown in Fig. 1, and the structure of the ligands in Fig. 2.",1
17,The formation of metal–ligand complexes can be quantified in terms of chemical equilibria and the corresponding complexation constants.,3
18,"However, as soon as multi-center complexes are being considered, the number of constants becomes very large, and this approach becomes impractical.",3
19,"For this reason, a parameterization of these constants in terms of only a few chemically meaningful parameters is necessary.",1
20,"Ercolani's work focusses exactly on this problem, as he attempts to express formation constants of multi-center complexes in terms of two intrinsic constants and symmetry numbers.",3
21,"A classical topic, where such questions arise, are acid–base equilibria of polyelectrolytes (, proton binding).",1
22,"In the early fifties, Kirkwood, Steiner, and Marcus had shown how to formulate a site binding model for this situation, and this approach has been extended until recently.",1
23,The free energy of a microscopic protonation state is expressed in terms of a small number of parameters.,3
24,"Normally, these include microscopic binding constants for each site and site–site pair interaction energies.",3
25,"For an infinite polyelectrolyte chain, the binding isotherms can be evaluated by standard techniques borrowed from statistical mechanics.",3
26,"For finite oligomers, one recovers the classical description in terms of chemical equilibria, and the corresponding protonation constants can be expressed in terms of microscopic binding constants and pair interaction energies.",3
27,This parameterization appears to be the appropriate one to obtain the necessary simplification of the description of acid–base equilibria of polyprotic acids or bases.,3
28,"One encounters a similar problem, when one attempts to interpret the binding of metal ions by polyelectrolytes.",1
29,"Such charged macromolecules have linear or branched structures, and offer a large number of coordination sites.",1
30,Polyelectrolytes may therefore bind a larger number of metal ions.,1
31,"For example, dendrimers have been reported to complex several hundreds of copper(ii) ions.",1
32,"Again, such systems cannot be described by a small number of complexation constants, and an alternative approach is needed.",1
33,"To approach such questions, microscopic site binding models have been proposed to address the competition between protons and multi-dentate metal binding to polyelectrolytes.",1
34,"In this publication, we develop this topic further and discuss a site binding model to describe binding of different metal ions to a multi-center receptor with well-defined binding sites, see Fig. 1.",9
35,The receptor may consist of several preassembled ligands.,9
36,This paper is structured as follows.,1
37,"First, we introduce the appropriate parameterization in terms of microscopic complexation constants and metal–metal pair interaction energies, elucidate the differences between microscopic and macroscopic equilibria in these systems, and extend the description to macromolecular receptors.",0
38,"The model will be first discussed with simple examples, including small and infinitely large receptors.",9
39,In the last section the applicability of the model to experimental binding constants is illustrated.,9
40,The experimentally inclined reader is welcome to proceed to this section directly.,1
41,"Consider a receptor with several binding sites, each of which can bind a single metal ion.",6
42,"Once the site is occupied with a metal ion, it can no longer bind any others.",6
43,"If a metal ion of type  is bound to a site , the corresponding element of the state vector () is defined to be unity, and all the other elements are zero.",6
44,The state of all sites can be then described with a state vector .,6
45,"To a first approximation, the effective free energy of the metal-receptor complex can be written as a general linear and quadratic expression in the state variables, namely where the chemical potential term can be related to the activity of metal  as () =  ln (), where () is the microscopic association constant of the center  for the metal of type , and  the thermal energy.",6
46,We have further denoted by () the pair interaction energy between two metal ions  and  occupying the sites  and .,6
47,"Note that the pair interaction energy is symmetric upon exchange of the indices  and , as well as  and .",6
48,The free energy eqn. (1) is a straightforward generalization of the treatment of protonation equilibria.,6
49,"Given the free energy of the metal–receptor complex, we can express the semi-grand canonical partition function aswhere the sum extends over all possible states {}.",6
50,"The binding isotherm for the metal  and center  can be written as a thermal average over the state variable, namelywhere the thermal average of a function ({}) is defined as.",6
51,The overall binding fraction of the metal  can be expressed aswhere  is the total number of sites of the receptor.,6
52,These isotherms obey the thermodynamic consistency relation,6
53,"Based on the present description, one can obtain expressions for equilibrium constants for the chemical equilibria between different species.",6
54,"For the sake of simplicity, let us consider two types of metal ions M and M only.",6
55,The generalization of the following arguments to an arbitrary number of metal ions is straightforward.,6
56,"Commonly, solution equilibria are described in terms of macrospecies, where only the total number and type of metal ions are specified, but it is not specified to which site they are bound.",6
57,The formation of such macrospecies can be described in terms of a chemical reaction L + M + M ⇌ LM(1)M(2)which can be characterized in terms of macroscopic cumulative equilibrium constants .,6
58,"The latter can be obtained by expanding the partition function in terms of the activities  and , and as the result one obtains the binding polynomial.",6
59,"From this expression, the probability of a macrospecies, or in other words its relative concentration, can be expressed as.",6
60,"From these macrospecies probabilities, the binding isotherms can be directly obtained as.",6
61,These expressions reflect the basic fact that the overall binding isotherms depend on the probabilities of the corresponding macrostates.,6
62,Each macrospecies normally corresponds to a collection of several microspecies.,6
63,A microspecies is defined with a set of given state variable vectors {}.,6
64,"The probability of such a species (, its relative concentration) can be written as.",6
65,Let us express the macrostate probability in terms of the microstate probabilities where δ is unity for  =  and zero otherwise.,6
66,"From this expression we find that the probability of the microspecies can be split into two terms, namely, ({}) = π({}|)(,)the macrostate probability (,), and the conditional microstate probability where the Kronecker's δ is unity for  =  and zero otherwise.",6
67,This conditional probability expresses the relative probability to find a given microstate within a particular macrostate.,6
68,The important advantage of introducing this conditional probability is that this quantity is a constant and independent of the metal activities.,6
69,The entire concentration dependence is captured by the macrostate probability.,6
70,Equilibrium constants of microscopic equilibria can be discussed in this framework as well.,6
71,Recall that the binding state of the receptor is uniquely defined with a set of given state variable vectors {}.,6
72,Consider now a chemical equilibrium between two species ({′}) ⇌ ({})the state vectors of which are identical with the exception of the elements () = 0 and ′() = 1.,6
73,"This reaction corresponds to a microscopic equilibrium, where the site  eliminates a metal of type , but the binding state of the rest of receptor remains unchanged.",6
74,"The successive equilibrium constant for the reaction eqn. (16) can be obtained from the free energy difference of these states, and yields the result.",6
75,Note that the previously introduced binding constant () corresponds to the inverse of the microconstant for the release of a metal of type  from site  when all other sites of the receptor are empty.,6
76,Different binding states of receptors with a small number of sites can be enumerated by hand.,6
77,"Larger structures can be enumerated on a computer, even though the number of sites accessible with this technique remains limited to about 20–30.",6
78,"Larger systems can be either treated by Monte Carlo simulation, or certain structures by transfer matrix techniques.",6
79,"In particular, the latter can be used to address systems in the limit of large number of sites in a straightforward fashion.",6
80,"To introduce the transfer matrix technique, consider a linear structure and nearest neighbor pair range interactions.",6
81,"Thereby, one introduces a recursion relation between the partition function of a chain with  sites and with  + 1.",6
82,"In order to define this recursion, let us consider a restricted partition function for a sub-chain of length , such that the values of the state vector of the last site are restricted to given values , namely where δ is unity when  = ′ and zero otherwise.",6
83,"By arranging the elements of the restricted partition function () into a column vector , the transfer matrix  can be defined as  = .",6
84,"Adopting this notation, we assume that the sites are numbered from the left to the right.",6
85,"As will be discussed in the following, transfer matrices have simple forms for nearest neighbor pair interactions.",6
86,The recursion relation eqn. (19) can be initiated with the partition vector for the first site .,6
87,"However, it is usually more practical to generate this restricted partition function by the application of the transfer matrix to a suitably chosen generating vector  such that  = .",6
88,"As will be exemplified below, the advantage of introducing this vector is its simple structure.",6
89,The partition function of the entire chain can be then obtained by summing over all the states of the sub-chain.,6
90,"Again, this operation can be formulated in a matrix notation, by defining a terminating vector .",6
91,"Usually this vector contains unit entries, and one can write eqn. (20) as a scalar product  = where  denotes the transposed (row) vector.",6
92,The partition function can be now written in a compact fashion as  = .,6
93,"Based on this formulation, many properties of finite and infinite chains can be obtained in a straightforward way.",6
94,"For example, the long chain limit is typically dominated with the largest eigenvalue  of the transfer matrix .",6
95,"The partition function is asymptotically given by  ∼  for  → ∞If the largest eigenvalue cannot be found analytically, it can be easily calculated numerically.",6
96,The binding isotherms are then obtained from eqn. (5).,6
97,This situation is completely analogous to the situation of proton binding discussed in detail elsewhere.,1
98,"Nevertheless, it is important to understand this case for our discussion of the multicomponent case.",1
99,"For this reason, a few major features will be summarized here.",1
100,"In this situation, the state vector has only one element, and the index  can be suppressed.",6
101,"In the situation of identical sites and nearest neighbor interactions the free energy is given by where  is a chemical potential term, and  is the pair interaction energy between the sites  and .",6
102,"Due to Coulombic forces between charged metal ions, the interactions are repulsive and  > 0.",6
103,The chemical potential term  can be related to the metal ion activity  and the microscopic binding constant  of the metal to a binding center when all other centers are empty by  =  ln .,6
104,Let us now consider three examples.,1
105,"The first two concern small receptors, and the last one the infinite linear chain.",1
106,"The situation of a symmetric receptor with three equivalent sites is simple to discuss, see Fig. 3.",6
107,"Since all the sites are equivalent, there is only one type of the metal–receptor complex, and the microstate is equivalent to the macrostate.",6
108,"The microscopic binding constant to bind a metal ion to the site will be denoted as , which is the inverse of the microconstant to remove it.",6
109,"The macroscopic formation constant  involves a statistical factor of 3, since there are three sites on which the metal ion can bind to the receptor.",6
110,"When two metal ions bind to the receptor, there is again only one type of the metal–receptor complex, and the microstate is also equivalent to the macrostate.",6
111,"The macroscopic formation constant  involves the square of the microconstant, as two metal ions are being bound, the statistical factor of 3, and the pair interaction parameter , which is related to the pair interaction energy  by  = − ln .",6
112,The inverse microconstant for removing a metal ion involves the binding constant  and one pair interaction .,6
113,"The macroconstant  for the fully occupied receptor involves the cube of the microconstant, three pair interactions, and no statistical factor.",6
114,"When we remove a metal ion of the fully occupied receptor, we overcome the binding constant and two pair interactions, obtaining the inverse of .",6
115,"The second example involves a linear receptor, with two equivalent terminal sites, and one central site, see Fig. 4.",6
116,"There are two possible microstates, when one binds one metal ion to the receptor, namely either to the terminal site or to the central site.",6
117,"We assume that the microconstant of these sites is the same for all sites, and will be denoted by . The inverse of this value corresponds to the microconstant for the removal of the metal ion.",6
118,"Since these constants are the same for all three sites, the conditional probability to find the microspecies with the central site occupied is 1/3, while when the terminal site is occupied 2/3.",6
119,The latter factor of two arises since there are two equivalent terminal sites.,6
120,"The macroconstant  is given by three times the microconstant , since each species contributes in the same way.",6
121,One also obtains two microspecies when the receptor binds two metal ions.,6
122,"In the first species, one terminal site and one central site are occupied.",6
123,"This microspecies invokes a nearest neighbor pair interaction, denoted by the parameter , and the square of the microconstants.",6
124,"To remove a metal ion from this species, the inverse microconstant involves a factor  and we eliminate a pair interaction, which involves a factor .",6
125,"In the other microspecies, both terminal sites are occupied.",6
126,"For this species, which has a symmetry number of 2, it may be necessary to consider the typically weaker next neighbor pair interaction.",6
127,"However, this interaction will be neglected here.",6
128,"The microconstant to remove a metal ion is now given by the inverse of . Summing up the contributions of both species, we thus find the macroconstant  and the conditional probabilities of each microspecies.",6
129,"The receptor fully occupied with metal ions invokes two nearest neighbor pair interactions, and thus invokes a factor .",6
130,"From these considerations, we obtain the conditional microstate probabilities and the macroconstants shown in Fig. 4.",6
131,"To remove a metal ion, there are two different microconstants as the terminal site involves only one pair interaction, and the central one two.",6
132,"In the case of linear chain, one can use the transfer matrix technique to obtain these results.",6
133,"In the case of a single metal ion, equivalent sites, and nearest neighbor interactions, the transfer matrix is given by where we have introduced the reduced activity  = .The two supplementary (transposed) partition vectors are ̃ = (1,0) and ̃ = (1, 1).",6
134,The partition functions can be evaluated by inserting these quantities into eqn. (22).,6
135,"For example, for a chain with three sites ( = 3) one obtains  = 1 + 3 + (1 + 2) + .",6
136,"Inserting eqn. (26) in eqn. (27) and comparing term-by-term with eqn. (8) the macroscopic binding constants  follow, in agreement with Fig. 4.",6
137,Let us now consider the long chain limit as the last example.,6
138,"This model is equivalent to the so-called Ising model, which is amply discussed in the statistical mechanics literature.",6
139,The largest eigenvalue of eqn. (25) can be evaluated analytically as.,6
140,"With eqns. (23) and (5), an analytical expression of the binding isotherm of a linear chain follows () = [2 + (()/)(1 − )/(1 −  + ())].",6
141,Note that this isotherm is identical to the case of proton binding to a polyelectrolyte.,1
142,"In the absence of interactions ( = 0 or  = 1), this isotherm reduces to the familiar Langmuir isotherm.",6
143,This behavior of this isotherm is shown in Fig. 5.,6
144,"In the absence of interactions, the isotherm has the classical sigmoidal shape in the semi-logarithmic representation.",6
145,"With increasing repulsive interactions, it develops a two-hump structure with an intermediate plateau at  = 1/2.",6
146,"The intermediate plateau originates from the stabilization of an intermediate structure, where a bound metal ion alternates with an empty site, see Fig. 6(a).",6
147,"With attractive interactions, a sharp transition takes place.",6
148,"Within this transitions, the metal ions cluster together, see Fig. 6(b).",6
149,"For repulsive interactions, the first hump in the binding isotherm is located at log  = log , while the second hump at log  = log  −2 where  = −log = /(ln10).",6
150,The location of these humps is simply understood.,6
151,"Initially, the metal ions bind to the empty sites, and thus with the microconstant log . Beyond the plateau, the metal ions must bind between two occupied centers.",6
152,"They have to overcome two pair interactions, and thus bind with a microconstant of log  − 2.",6
153,Let us now present the treatment of two types of metal ions using the three examples already discussed.,9
154,The first example is the symmetric receptor with three equivalent sites.,9
155,"In the presence of two metal ions, three types of complexes form.",6
156,"Complexes will form only with the first metal ion, provided the activity of the second metal ions is small, see Fig. 3.",6
157,"The same complexes form with the second metal ion, when the activity of the first metal ion is small.",6
158,"In the intermediate situation, one obtains mixed complexes shown in Fig. 7.",6
159,"Obviously, there are only mixed complexes with two or three metal ions.",6
160,"Due to symmetry, the microspecies are again equivalent to the macrospecies.",6
161,"The complex with two different metal ions involves one pair interaction energy , and this interaction will be abbreviated with the parameter .",6
162,The macroconstant  is obtained by realizing that the microspecies has a symmetry number of six.,6
163,"The microconstants to remove each metal ion can be again evaluated by considering the affinities of the metal ions to the sites and by considering the pair interaction, and their inverse values are given in Fig. 7.",6
164,"There is one complex involving three metal ions, with one from one kind and two from the other kind.",6
165,"This complex involves three pair interactions, namely one between the same metal ions, and two between different ones.",6
166,The macroconstants  and  of both complexes follow by taking into account the symmetry number of three.,6
167,"Let us now consider the second example of the linear receptor with three sites, which has two equivalent terminal sites and one central site.",6
168,"For the matter of illustration, let us assume that the affinity of the terminal and central sites are the same.",6
169,"Again, three types of complexes will form.",6
170,"Complexes with the first metal ion for sufficiently low activity of the second metal ion, complexes with the second metal ion for sufficiently low activity of the first metal ion, and mixed complexes.",6
171,"The complexes with one metal ion has been discussed above, see Fig. 4, while Fig. 8 summarizes the mixed complexes.",6
172,"There are three nonequivalent microstates, each of which has a symmetry number of two.",6
173,"Either one metal ion occupies the central site, and a nearest neighbor pair interaction has to be considered in this case.",6
174,This case leads to two microstates.,6
175,"Alternatively, both metal ions occupy the terminal sites.",6
176,"These three microspecies have to be considered, when the macroconstant  of the complex with two different metal ions is evaluated.",6
177,The inverse values of the various microconstants to remove the respective metal ions are also indicated.,6
178,"When three metal ions are bound, two sites are occupied by one type of the metal ion, and the remaining site with the second type.",6
179,"Two macrospecies are possible, depending whether there are two metal ions of type one or of type two.",6
180,"In either situation, we have two microstates, depending on the fact whether the two terminal sites are occupied with the same metal ion or with two different ones.",6
181,The macroconstants  and  are again obtained by considering the pair interactions and the symmetry numbers.,6
182,The microconstants follow as above.,6
183,The transfer matrix formalism can be extended to competitive metal binding to linear receptors in a straightforward fashion.,6
184,Consider two metal ions and assume nearest neighbor interactions.,6
185,The transfer matrix reads where we have introduced the abbreviations  =  and  = exp(−/).,6
186,"The generating and terminating vectors are given by  = (1,0,0) and  = (1,1,1).",6
187,"Again, the properties of short chains can be evaluated analytically.",6
188,"For example, the trimer ( = 3) is now described with a partition function.",6
189,"Again, by equating the coefficients of eqn. (32) with eqn. (8) one obtains the macroscopic binding constants , as shown in Figs. 4 and 8.",6
190,"In long chain limit, the largest eigenvalue cannot be evaluated analytically in the general case.",6
191,"However, an analytical solution is possible if we specialize to the important case of equal pair interactions, namely  =  =  = .",6
192,The solution can be expressed in terms of the solution of the linear chain for a single metal ion.,6
193,Some algebra leads to the closed form of the adsorption isotherm where () is the mono-component isotherm given by eqn. (29) evaluated at  =  + .,6
194,"In the absence of interactions, this isotherm reduces to the competitive Langmuir isotherm.",6
195,"In the general case, when  ≠  ≠  the isotherm can be found numerically by evaluating the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.",6
196,Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate the main features of these isotherms.,8
197,"On the top of both figures, the binding isotherm for the first metal ion is shown as a function of its activity for fixed activities of the second metal ion.",8
198,"On the bottom, the isotherm for the second metal is shown in the same representation.",8
199,The results for the analytically soluble case with equal interaction parameters are shown in Fig. 9.,8
200,"At low activities of the second metal ion, the receptor fills up through the alternating full-empty configuration discussed above, see Fig. 6(a).",5
201,"At high activities of the second metal ion, the second metal exchanges with the first one.",8
202,This process follows the one-to-one exchange isotherm since there is no difference in the interactions between the two metal ions.,5
203,"As a consequence, a disordered intermediate structure is formed (Fig. 6(c)).",5
204,An example of unequal interaction parameters is shown in Fig. 10.,8
205,"At low activities of the second metal ion, the receptor again fills up through the alternating full–empty configuration (Fig. 6(a)).",5
206,"At high activities of the second metal ion, on the other hand, the second metal exchanges with the first one following an effective repulsive interaction between both metal ions, and leading to an intermediate plateau.",5
207,The intermediate structure is again alternating (Fig. 6(d)).,8
208,"The binding isotherm of the second metal shows an interesting transition region, as the isotherm becomes steep in the intermediate activity regime.",8
209,"When both components are in excess, one can show that the model can be again reduced to the linear chain model with the effective pair interaction energy  =  +  − 2or equivalently.",5
210,The normalized activity now is  = 212/(222) for the first metal ion.,5
211,"Depending on the magnitude of the individual interactions, at intermediate loading one can obtain random arrangements for  = 0, alternating arrangements for  > 0, or clustering of the same metal ions for  < 0 (see Fig. 6).",5
212,"For the situation shown in Fig. 9 a random structure forms ( = 0), while in the one shown in Fig. 10 the alternating structure forms ( = 15 kJ mol > 0).",8
213,Multi-center complexes of lanthanides provide good examples for the mechanisms discussed here.,9
214,"For this reason, we shall focus on those, but applications to other complexes should be envisioned as well.",9
215,"As a first example, consider trimetallic complexes of 1,3,5-triamino-1,3,5-trideoxy--inositol (taci) H with Nd, Sm, and Eu (see Fig. 1 and 2).",9
216,"These complexes form in water according to the equilibrium 2H + Nd + Sm + (3 −  − )Eu ⇌ [NdSmEu()] + 6Hwhere ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3 with  +  ≤ 3 and  corresponds to the deprotonated ligand.",6
217,The measured equilibrium constants are reported in Table 1.,8
218,"In order to apply the site binding model, which treats the binding of metal ions to one receptor, we consider the conditional equilibrium 2 + Nd + Sm + (3 −  − )Eu ⇌ [NdSmEu()]where  refers to all solution species of the ligand.",6
219,We choose pH 8 as reference.,3
220,"From the known ionization constants of H, one can evaluate the conditional constants of these equilibria.",3
221,"These conditional constants are given in Table 1, and only those will be considered further.",8
222,"The site binding model introduces three microscopic binding constants ,  and  and six pair interaction energies .",6
223,"We simplify the interaction energy matrix further by assuming that the diagonal elements  and off-diagonal elements  ( ≠ ) are the same, respectively, leaving us with two pair interaction energies to be determined.",6
224,"Since only the complexes with three lanthanide ions exist, one cannot estimate both interaction energies independently.",6
225,"For this reason, we set the diagonal term  = 18.7 kJ mol.",6
226,"This value can be estimated from interaction of an effective charge near +2, which are obtained from  calculations, and calculated for the distance of 3.61 Å invoking the Coulomb law in water.",6
227,"With this value, the model contains four adjustable parameters, which we extract by non-linear least squares fit from the constants of the nine complexes containing one or two different metal ions (see Table 1).",6
228,"We obtain three microscopic constants log  = 10.56, log  = 12.20, and log  = 12.64.",8
229,The off-diagonal pair interaction turns out to be  = 19.4 kJ mol ( ≠ ) and recall that we set  = 18.7 kJ mol.,5
230,The fit cannot be substantially improved by allowing for further variation in the interaction parameters.,5
231,"To test the predictive capabilities of the model, we have calculated the constant of the ternary complex [NdSmEu()] (see Table 1).",0
232,The experimental value of its common logarithm is 25.90 and the model predicts 25.98.,5
233,"This result can be considered as very satisfactory, since the model was calibrated on binary systems only.",4
234,The model therefore captures the interactions between the different lanthanide ions properly.,4
235,"From this model description, we can extract various properties of interest.",1
236,"Naturally, once the macroscopic constants are known, the macrostate probabilities can be computed (see Fig. 11).",4
237,"The macrostate probabilities are displayed as a function of the free concentration ratio [Sm]/[Nd], where the free concentrations have been set equal to the activities for simplicity.",8
238,The total concentration of the three metals was set to 0.1 M and the overall mole fraction  of the Eu-ion was fixed.,6
239,"In the absence of Eu, one observes the classical evolution from the [Nd()] complex, through the mixed binary complexes [NdSm()] and [NdSm()], to the [Sm()] complex (see Fig. 11(a)).",8
240,"At  = 0.01, various mixed complexes appear, in particular the mixed ternary complex [NdSmEu()] (see Fig. 11(b)).",8
241,"At  = 0.1, binary complexes not containing Eu disappear, and the evolution is dominated by the complexes [Eu()], [EuSm()], [EuSm()] and [Sm()] (see Fig. 11(c)).",8
242,"The microscopic picture is very simple in this case, as each macrostate consists of a single microstate (see Fig. 12).",5
243,"However, as the pair interaction energies between different metal ions are somewhat larger than between the same metal ions, the microscopic constants increase with increasing number of different neighboring metal ions.",5
244,This effect leads to a destabilization of the metal ions in the mixed complexes (see Fig. 12).,5
245,"Moreover, one observes that Nd is bound the weakest in the complex, Sm is intermediate, and Eu is bound the strongest.",4
246,"As a second example, consider the monometallic and bimetallic helicates of the general formula [LaEu()] (,  = 0, 1, 2) and trimetallic helicates of the formula [LaEu()] ( = 0, 1, 2, 3, see Fig. 1 and 2).",9
247,"To analyze the formation constants, we assume that the bimetallic and trimetallic complexes have equal interactions, and thus we use the whole series to extract the microscopic parameters.",6
248,The formation constants to be analyzed are summarized in Table 2.,6
249,"We note that the complexes [La()] and [Eu()] have been also described, but their structure is probably rather different, and they are not considered here.",1
250,"In order to simplify the structure of the model, let us consider the equilibrium constant of the exchange reaction [LaLa()] + [EuEu()] ⇌ 2[LaEu()].",6
251,"This exchange constant has been shown to be 4 within experimental error, meaning that the fraction in eqn. (41) can be well approximated by unity.",6
252,"In other words, the pair interaction energies obey the mixing rule.",6
253,The off-diagonal terms are now simply approximated by an arithmetic average of the corresponding diagonal terms.,6
254,Note that this mixing rule imposes no effective interactions in the saturated state (. eqn. (36)).,6
255,The site binding model now contains the following parameters.,6
256,These include microscopic binding constants for both metal ions to the terminal site (La)t and (Eu)t and to the central site (La)c and (Eu)c.,6
257,"When we consider nearest neighbor interactions only, we now have two pair interaction energies, namely , .",6
258,The cross term  is obtained from eqn. (42).,6
259,These six parameters can be extracted from the nine constants given in Table 2.,6
260,The experimental equilibrium constants can be described with the site binding model extremely well (see Table 2).,5
261,The resulting parameters are the microscopic constants for the terminal sites log (La)t = 16.70 and log (Eu)t = 19.10.,5
262,For the central site we have log (La)c = 17.91 and log (EuEu)c = 21.08.,8
263,The nearest neighbor pair interaction energies are  = 47.5 kJ mol and  = 69.5 kJ mol.,8
264,"Independent fit of the off-diagonal terms gives a value of the off-diagonal terms, which is very close to the value predicted by the mixing rule eqn. (42), and leads to no improvement to the fit.",5
265,Consideration of a next nearest neighbor interaction energy gives equally no effect.,5
266,"Based on these model parameters, various macroscopic and microscopic properties of these helicates can be predicted.",8
267,"Fig. 13 shows the macroscopic properties of the trimetallic helicates with the formula [LaEu()] ( = 0, 1, 2, 3).",8
268,"The macrostate probabilities, which are normalized to the total concentration of the saturated complexes, are shown in Fig. 13a.",8
269,"As the concentration ratio [Eu]/[La] is increased, one goes through the characteristic sequence of the macrospecies [La()], [LaEu()], [LaEu()] and [Eu()].",5
270,Fig. 13(b) shows the relative fraction of metal bound in the trimetallic helicates.,8
271,One observes that the exchange between Eu and La occurs in a relatively narrow concentration range.,5
272,"For each mixed complex (macrospecies), there are two possible structures (microspecies), each of which has always a fixed relative fraction within the macrostate.",5
273,Fig. 14 summarizes their microscopic properties.,5
274,"The macrospecies [LaEu()] consists of the two microspecies, the dominant asymmetric complex [EuLaLa()] and the symmetric minority complex [LaEuLa()].",5
275,"On the other hand, in the macrospecies [LaEu()] the symmetric complex [EuLaEu()] is dominant, while the asymmetric complex [LaEuEu()] is in minority.",5
276,"This observation is consistent with NMR results, since the two minority complexes could not be detected.",4
277,The microconstants to remove the respective metal ions from each site are summarized in Fig. 14.,5
278,One observes that the terminal metal ions are much more tightly bound that the central ones.,5
279,This effect is mainly caused by the additional electrostatic repulsion between the sites.,4
280,One further observes that the binding of La is weakened through the presence of neighboring Eu ions.,5
281,"The same trend can be also observed for Eu, as its binding is also weakened by the presence of neighboring La ions.",5
282,"In this paper, we have presented a microscopic site binding model treating binding of several metal ions to preassembled multi-center receptors with well-defined binding sites within a statistical mechanical framework.",4
283,We introduce the appropriate parameterization in terms of microscopic complexation constants and metal–metal pair interaction energies.,5
284,"From this model, the distinction between microscopic and macroscopic equilibria in these systems enters in a natural way.",5
285,"With the present approach one can not only treat receptors with a small number of binding sites, but also macromolecular receptors capable of binding a large number of metal ions.",4
286,This situation is illustrated with linear chains.,5
287,"The applicability of the model has been illustrated with examples of lanthanide complexes, namely mixed trimetallic -inositol complexes and multi-metallic helicates.",5
288,"In both situations, we find that consideration of pair interactions is important to obtain an acceptable description of the data.",4
289,"However, the general structure of the pair interaction matrix is not obvious at this point.",4
290,"While for multi-metallic helicates a simple mixing rule appears to represent a reasonable approximation of the off-diagonal elements of the matrix, for the inositol complexes deviations from this rule are observed.",4
291,Further experimental data sets are necessary to settle such questions in detail.,4
292,Predictive capabilities of the site binding model were illustrated with the inositol complexes.,5
293,"Thus, one can predict binding constants of metal complexes from a limited set of experimental data.",4
294,The example of the multi-metallic helicates did show that from a homologous series one can obtain a sufficient number of experimental quantities in order to fix the model parameters.,5
295,"In both cases, the model is able to predict all details of the microscopic equilibria, including microstate probabilities and microscopic equilibrium constants.",4
296,An analogous formulation can be applicable when the receptor undergoes conformational transitions.,4
297,"However, the parameters considered must be interpreted as thermal averages over the different conformational states.",4
298,"Moreover, more long-range interactions and eventually higher order interactions (, triplets) must be considered.",4
299,The present formulation certainly represents an appropriate way to treat binding of several metal ions to one type of multi-center receptor.,4
300,"In most situations, however, the receptor is composed of different ligands, which have to assemble in order to form the complex.",4
301,"As long as all complexes are composed of the same number of ligands (, helicates) the present approach applies.",4
302,"On the other hand, when the complexes contain different numbers of sub-units, the present approach must be generalized in order to incorporate this situation.",4
303,"In the protein literature, this problem is referred to as aggregation of ligands, but a useful parameterization of this problem is not known.",4
304,These aspects will be the subject of future studies.,1
0,Creation of permanent lattice defects  exciton self-trapping into molecular states in Xe matrix,9
1,Electronic excitation is shown to affect the structural properties of the Xe matrix at low temperatures.,5
2,The lattice defect creation was studied using the selective vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopy methods.,9
3,The samples were excited by synchrotron radiation in the range of excitonic absorption.,3
4,The temporal evolution of the intensity distribution in the band of molecular type self-trapped exciton luminescence was analyzed.,9
5,A direct evidence for the creation and accumulation of point lattice defects in solid Xe  the excitonic mechanism was obtained for the first time.,5
6,The model of permanent lattice defect creation and transformation is discussed.,4
7,Physics and chemistry in cryomatrices is an active research field and rare-gas matrices have been used frequently in studies over many years.,1
8,Defects of structure are of substantial importance in the kinetics of solid-state chemical reactions and have a pronounced effect on the efficiency of formation and stability of radicals and ionic species in cryogenic solids.,2
9,The part of the defects in the accumulation of matrix-isolated species has already been discussed in earlier studies and the well-known “matrix-site” effect often involves lattice imperfections.,1
10,"Whereas in the case of “matrix-site” effect the defects adversely affect guest optical spectra causing a band broadening, the presence of defects, which can be seen as charge traps, is favourable for stabilization of ionic species in cryomatrices.",1
11,"To cite an example, the stabilization effect of structural defects on the intrinsic ionic species Rg, so-called self-trapped holes (STH), in cryomatrices was recently found in the experiments carried out at Bondybey’s Laboratory.",1
12,Another interesting example to mention is the influence of local matrix morphology on the formation of neutral ground-state chemical compounds involving rare-gas atoms.,1
13,A special type of lattice defects is an electronically induced point defect–Frenkel pair.,1
14,These defects are created in different classes of wide-gap insulators and even in narrow-gap materials.,1
15,The basis for the physics of electronically induced lattice rearrangement is a concentration of the excitation energy released in the relaxation process within a volume about that of a unit cell followed by the energy transfer to the surrounding matrix.,1
16,The rare-gas solids are characterized by extremely small binding energies in comparison with the energies of electronic excitations.,1
17,The difference in energies is of the order of 10–10.,1
18,"This peculiarity in conjunction with the strong electron–phonon interaction followed by the self-trapping of excitons and holes results in a high quantum yield for the electronically induced processes, making the rare-gas matrices excellent objects for studying the topic under consideration.",1
19,Despite the aforementioned attractive properties of the rare-gas solids the experimental study into electronically induced defect creation was undertaken not so long ago.,1
20,The first efforts were concentrated on defect creation  self-trapping of excitons into atomic states that is the case for solid Ne.,3
21,These high-resolution spectral studies revealed a creation and accumulation of point defects in the Ne lattice under irradiation by slow electrons.,3
22,The self-trapping of excitons into atomic states is suggested to be a stimulating factor.,1
23,The direct experimental proof of this mechanism of defect creation was provided by a recent study carried out with synchrotron radiation.,1
24,The results obtained in combination with the activation spectroscopy study supported the theoretical model of the evolution of atomic self-trapped excitons (A-STE) into permanent lattice defects—Frenkel pairs of the second neighbour configuration.,1
25,"The spectroscopic investigation of lattice defect creation in the case of exciton self-trapping into molecular states, as occurred in solid Xe, Kr and Ar, is a rigorous task.",1
26,In contrast to the case of exciton self-trapping into atomic states the luminescence spectra of molecular self-trapped excitons (M-STE) have a shape of broad bands stemming from the electronic transition from the Σ+u to a repulsive part of the ground state Σ+g (the well-known M bands.),1
27,The design of a special cryogenic cell for sample growth enabled us to grow samples of high crystal quality and to reveal the internal structure of the M bands.,3
28,It has been shown that the M band in all rare-gas solids consists of two components—M (related to the molecular centers in the defect sites) and M (related to the molecular centers formed in the regular lattice at the exciton self-trapping).,1
29,The interpretation was supported by the recent experiments on selective excitation by synchrotron radiation.,1
30,The existence of these two components in the M bands provides a way for application of the sensitive VUV luminescence spectroscopy method to characterize the samples and to study the electronically induced defect creation.,1
31,Even in our first studies slow electrons were used for the excitation in order to prevent the knock-on defect creation—formation of defects by elastic collisions.,3
32,"The accumulation of radiation-induced defects was detected in all heavy rare-gas solids—Ar, Kr and Xe.",1
33,The comprehensive study performed in pure and doped Kr matrices permitted us to suggest mechanisms of defect creation  exciton self-trapping into molecular states.,1
34,"However, the direct proof of the excitonic mechanism requires experiments with state-selective excitation.",3
35,The synchrotron radiation providing an intense VUV light tunable through the range of excitonic absorption of rare-gas solids is best suited to such an experiment.,3
36,This paper reports the results of a synchrotron radiation study into permanent lattice defect creation in the Xe matrix  excitonic mechanism.,9
37,"The experimental findings are compared with the results obtained under electron beam irradiation, and discussed in relation to the suggested model of defect creation.",9
38,"Investigation of electronically induced lattice rearrangement requires definite experimental conditions—first, high quality samples with low concentration of initial defects and impurities, then subthreshold excitation of the samples using slow particles of energy deficient to produce defects  knock-on mechanism or photons of appropriate energy, and finally, excitation of the samples at low temperatures to exclude the conventional thermally-activated defect creation.",6
39,The study to be described was performed at the SUPERLUMI station of the Hamburger Synchrotronstrahlungslabor HASYLAB at DESY.,10
40,"The set-up designed for luminescence experiments in the VUV range is given elsewhere, so only essential details are mentioned here.",10
41,The samples of required quality were grown in a special closed cell mounted on a He-flow cryostat holder in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment (10 mbr).,10
42,"High-purity Xe gas (99.9996%) was used, and the gas handling system was operated under UHV conditions.",10
43,The samples were condensed from the vapour phase at elevated temperature under isobaric conditions ( = 1000 Pa) with a constant cooling in the temperature range 125–110 K. Then the temperature was controllably reduced at a constant rate of 0.1 Ks.,10
44,"After the sample preparation and cooling, the cell was removed and the free-standing cryocrystal of 1 mm thickness was studied.",10
45,The polycrystalline samples thus produced were optically transparent.,8
46,The intense luminescence of free excitons indicated their high quality.,5
47,The samples were then subjected to prolonged irradiation by the VUV light.,10
48,The selective excitation was carried out with a bandpass of Δ = 0.25 nm.,10
49,The excitation energy was chosen in the range of the  = 2 term of the Γ(3/2) excitonic series.,10
50,The luminescence analysis was performed with Δ = 2 nm by using a 0.5 m high-flux Pouey VUV monochromator equipped with a multisphere plate detector.,10
51,The entire M band was periodically recorded during exposure.,10
52,The following decomposition of the M band into M and M subbands yielded the dose dependence of the defect component and the regular one.,10
53,The influence of the annealing at 60 K on the intensity distribution in the M band was examined.,9
54,To probe the defects we used thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL).,3
55,The electron-hole pairs were generated by a short-term exposure to the VUV radiation.,10
56,On completion of the irradiation the spectrum of the TSL was recorded.,10
57,"For comparison, we replicated the experiments with excitation by an electron beam following the identical procedure of the sample growing.",10
58,The experiments were performed at the Laboratory of Condensed System Spectroscopy at the Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics & Engineering NASU.,10
59,The samples were grown in a closed cell with an electromagnetic shutter mounted on a L-He cryostat holder in the vacuum chamber.,10
60,"After the sample preparation and its cooling, the shutter was open providing the free access for the electron beam and emerging luminescence.",10
61,"We used electrons of 1 keV energy, deficient to create defects by knock-on collisions.",10
62,The irradiation was performed under steady state conditions with a current density of 50 μA cm.,10
63,The dose was increased with exposure time.,10
64,The sequence of luminescence spectra was recorded using a normal incidence 1 m VUV monochromator with a bandpass of Δ = 0.16 nm.,10
65,The irradiation and measurements were performed at low temperature (15 K) in order to exclude the conventional thermal mechanism of defect creation and to avoid the annealing of the defects produced.,10
66,Fig. 1 demonstrates the internal structure of the M band in solid Xe and its temporal evolution under excitation by slow electrons.,8
67,The shape of the M band profoundly varies with exposure time.,8
68,These changes are caused by the intensity redistribution between the two components of its internal structure—M and M.,5
69,Each of the subbands approximated by the Gaussian is depicted in Fig. 1.,8
70,The dose dependence of the subband intensity is shown in the insert of Fig. 1.,8
71,The intensity of the M subband related to the exciton self-trapped in the regular lattice remains constant.,8
72,"The distinct enhancement of the defect subband M upon irradiation indicates an increase in the number of defect sites,  accumulation of permanent lattice defects.",5
73,The existence of the two subbands points to a branching of the relaxation channels.,5
74,Ionizing radiation (electrons in our case) creates primary excitations—free electron-hole pairs.,5
75,"Three channels of “indirect” exciton creation were found under selective excitation above the band gap energy : (i) recombination of electron-hole pairs, (ii) inelastic scattering of electrons, and (iii) excitonic side bands of valence or inner-shell excitation.",4
76,Free excitons can be then self-trapped in the regular lattice or trapped in some defect site.,4
77,The method of lattice defect detection developed in our studies is in fact a modification of the sensitized luminescence method.,4
78,The excitation energy is transferred to the defects by free excitons followed by their trapping and radiative decay yielding the M subband.,4
79,"Apparently, both kinds of defects—the initial structural defects and the defects created  electronic excitation—contribute to the M subband.",5
80,The contribution of the initial defects can be easily found by extrapolating the dose dependence of the M subband intensity to zero.,6
81,Let us take up possible channels of electronically induced defect creation keeping in mind that the key point for this process is the relaxation energy release in a confined region of the crystal.,9
82,"As was already mentioned, two efficient channels of electronic excitation self-trapping exist in the lattice of heavy rare-gas solids–formation of STEs and STHs.",6
83,"The secondary electrons produced under excitation well above  for the most part remain in the solid, and hence each hole has, in the mean, its counterpart—an electron elsewhere.",6
84,"Taking into account the fact that the electrons are characterized by free-like behavior in rare-gas solids, in other words, they are highly mobile, one can expect an efficient recombination on the electron thermalization.",6
85,"If a part of the electrons is trapped in some defect sites, STHs remain stable in the lattice at temperatures low enough to prohibit the release of the electrons from their traps.",6
86,"The exciton self-trapping caused by exciton–phonon interaction was found in all rare-gas solids and reported in a number of books, reviews and papers.",1
87,"The relevant relaxation processes involving the self-trapping of holes and excitons can be given by the reactions:Rg + Rg → Rg + Δ(STH) → Rg+ e → Rg* + Rg + Δ()Rg* + Rg → Rg* + Δ*(M-STE) →  (M-STE) + Rg + Rg + Δ()We take Rg and Rg* to denote a free hole and free exciton, respectively.",6
88,The first stage of these reactions corresponds to the self-trapping of holes (1) and excitons (2) followed by the formation of vibronically hot charged (STH) and neutral (M-STE) dimers.,6
89,Note that STH and M-STE might be considered as “matrix isolated” molecular centers within its own host crystal.,6
90,"While relaxing through the vibronic levels, the positively charged dimer STH can recombine with a thermalized electron into a repulsive electronic state yielding two Rg atoms separated energetically (a so called dissociative recombination ).",6
91,"At both relaxation stages an essential amount of energy Δ(STH) and Δ() is released in the vicinity of STH, which can be spent on the lattice defect creation.",6
92,The efficiency of this defect creation channel  recombination depends on the rate of electron thermalization and is not expected to be high.,6
93,In the case of exciton self-trapping by reaction (2) the relaxation energy is transferred to the surrounding atoms at both stages—in the excited state of the M-STE and in the ground state.,6
94,The energy release during the M-STE vibronic cooling Δ*(M-STE) is about 0.45 eV  which is higher than the binding energy per atom in solid Xe (172.3 meV .),6
95,"After the radiative transition ( (M-STE)) of the relaxed M-STE to a repulsive part of the ground state potential, the excess energy Δ() = 0.86 eV is shared between two dimer atoms, in other words, there appear the two “hot” atoms with a 0.43 eV kinetic energy available for the defect creation.",6
96,"In accordance with this consideration, the mechanisms of exciton-induced defect creation can be classified as an “excited state” mechanism and a “ground state” one.",6
97,In order to distinguish clearly the recombination (1) and excitonic (2) channels of defect creation the direct experiments with selective excitation into the exciton band were performed.,0
98,"First of all, the origin of the M and M subbands was verified using the advantages of the selective excitation by synchrotron radiation.",4
99,The shape of the M band in the luminescence spectrum of solid Xe measured at different excitation energies—below the bottom of the lowest exciton band  = 1 Γ(3/2) and in the range of the exciton absorption—is shown in Fig. 2 where the difference in the position and halfwidth FWHM of the M band is clearly seen.,8
100,The excitation below the exciton band gave rise to a defect M subband with a maximum at 7.05 eV.,8
101,The excitation above the Γ(3/2) exciton band bottom resulted in the appearance of two subbands with the predominance of a M subband at 7.22 eV.,8
102,"In order to shed more light on the origin of the internal structure of the M band, we restored the excitation spectra of the M and M subbands.",9
103,The earlier data on the excitation spectra obtained by the “red–blue-side” separation method supported the assignment of the M subband as originated from the M-STE in the regular lattice whereas the M subband was assigned to the exciton of molecular configuration trapped in the defect site.,5
104,"However, because of the strong overlapping of the two subbands the direct measurement of the separate excitation spectra of the M and M subbands is impossible.",5
105,"To restore the excitation spectra we used the following procedure: a series of luminescence spectra were recorded with a successive increase of the excitation energy, then the luminescence spectra recorded were resolved into the M and the M components and the intensities of each subband were plotted as a function of the excitation energy.",10
106,The resulting excitation spectra are shown in Fig. 3.,8
107,The solid line represents the total yield of the luminescence in the M band as a function of the excitation energy.,8
108,"The procedure applied enabled us to estimate the low energy excitation thresholds  and  for the M and M subbands, respectively:  = 8.18 eV,  = 8.28 eV.",5
109,"The careful check of the spatial distribution of the centers emitting M and M subbands, performed with the electron beam of different energy, and hence, of different penetration depth, demonstrated the bulk origin of both centers.",5
110,The results obtained provided solid evidence of the “defect” nature of the M subband and the intrinsic nature of the M subband—emission of the true M-STE center in the regular lattice.,4
111,Based on this assignment we measured the dose dependence of the M and M subbands to probe the defect creation upon excitation in the exciton band.,0
112,The primary monochromator was tuned to the energy of the  = 2 Γ(3/2) band in the absorption spectrum of solid Xe.,10
113,"Due to the low absorption coefficient the exciting light penetrated deep inside the sample, and the M-STE dimers were efficiently formed in the bulk.",5
114,A sequence of spectra were measured upon exposure to the VUV light.,9
115,The internal structure and the intensity distribution were analyzed.,9
116,The position and FWHM of the M and M subbands were obtained from the numerical fit of the band shape assuming a Gaussian shape of the subbands.,10
117,The result of this treatment—the corresponding points of the curves—yields the dose dependence of the subband intensity shown in Fig. 4.,8
118,The intensity of the M subband associated with the M-STE in the regular lattice remained constant during exposure to the VUV light.,8
119,At the first stage of VUV irradiation (up to 100 min) we observed a pronounced enhancement of the M subband intensity.,8
120,"Note that the exposure time is not corrected for the synchrotron radiation pulse duration, so it is in fact a real time of the measurements.",8
121,During the next 100 min we observed a saturation of the dose dependence of the M intensity followed by a slow decrease with long irradiation time.,5
122,"The dose dependence of radiation-induced point defect ( vacancies) concentration  is described by the following equation∂/∂ =  −  () − ) −  ( − )Here  is the coefficient that characterizes the rate of permanent defect creation  exciton self-trapping, whereas  and  are the coefficients of the vacancy-interstitial recombination and trapping by some kind of sinks, respectively.",6
123,"At low temperatures and small doses, the reactions of recombination and trapping are extremely slow, and we observe a linear increase of the M subband intensity indicating the accumulation of defects in the sample.",5
124,With increasing the concentration of the radiation-induced Frenkel pairs (interstitials and vacancies) the contribution of the defect annihilation processes (second and third terms of the equation) increases.,5
125,Note that at low temperatures the thermally activated diffusion of vacancies to sinks is negligible and only the radiation-induced defect motion comes to play.,5
126,One can suggest that on long-term exposure there occurs an aggregation of defects.,4
127,The details of the defect transformation on long-term irradiation invite further investigation.,4
128,Let us discuss some possible models of exciton-induced defect creation  self-trapping into molecular states—M-STE.,9
129,The self-trapping occurring during the lifetime of the excited state results in the formation of a molecular dimer aligned along the 〈110〉 crystallographic directions with an interatomic distance of 0.31 nm.,6
130,This stage followed by the M-STE formation in the on-center position is shown in Fig. 5 (a and b).,6
131,The center formed resembles a “dumb-bell” configuration of the interstitial atom.,6
132,Its displacement along the 〈110〉 direction to an off-center configuration (position c in Fig. 5) cannot stabilize the center.,6
133,It was shown that the split 〈100〉 “dumb-bell” form is the only stable form of the interstitial atom in the Xe lattice.,6
134,"The separation between the “dumb-bell” atoms is found to be 0.86 ( is the distance between the nearest neighbours), which only slightly exceeds the interatomic distance between the atoms in the Xe* dimer (0.31 nm).",5
135,"Bearing this in mind, one can assume that the short-lived defect of the off-center configuration can be stabilized by the reorientation of the dimer axis to the 〈100〉 direction ( in Fig. 5).",4
136,The Frank–Condon transition of this dimer to the ground state will correspond to the transition of the molecular center to the permanent defect level with almost no change in the interatomic distance.,6
137,The energy needed for the reorientation can be released in the lattice in the course of the vibronic relaxation.,6
138,"As the theory shows, in a system with a strong local vibration the energy release proceeds in a jump-like multiphonon process.",6
139,It seems to be the case for the M-STE relaxation which offers the basis for the development of the “excited state” mechanism.,6
140,The model of defect creation by the “ground state” mechanism is not as straightforward as it may seem at first sight.,6
141,"The matter is that during self-trapping Rg atoms are brought closer together displacing along the 〈110〉 direction, as shown in Fig. 5b.",6
142,"However, there are no stable interstitials of the “dumb-bell” configuration aligned along the 〈110〉 crystallographic direction.",6
143,The recent theoretical studies showed that in the fcc lattice of rare-gas solids the weak coupling between close-packed atomic rows and the crystal matrix may give rise to an interstitial atom of a specific configuration—a smeared clump called a crowdion.,1
144,"The vacancy also becomes delocalized, forming a smeared sparsed region (anticrowdion).",1
145,The computational results were presented for Ar and Kr cryoscrystals and it was mentioned that the formation of crowdions is also expected in the Xe lattice.,1
146,We performed the experiment with detection of a thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) spectrum of the samples irradiated by VUV photons.,9
147,The recorded TSL spectrum is shown in Fig. 6.,8
148,In view of the low TSL intensity the spectrum was collected over the heating time.,8
149,The recombination of STHs with electrons gives rise to the self-trapped excitons emitting the M subband.,5
150,If the hole is trapped in a defect site one can expect the appearance of the M subband in the TSL spectrum.,7
151,The comparison with the luminescence spectrum excited by photons of 8.86 eV energy (in the band of intrinsic exciton absorption of solid Xe) shows that the TSL band consists of two components M and M.,5
152,"Because of low intensity, reliable decomposition of the M band in the TSL spectrum is impossible.",4
153,"However, the contribution of both subbands can be ascertained.",4
154,TSL of solid Xe at the photon energy 7.2 eV after irradiation by X-rays was observed in  but the M and M subbands in the TSL band were not discriminated.,1
155,Note that the TSL from solid Xe grown at low temperature yielded a 7.6 eV band.,1
156,The recent study suggested this band to be originated from trimer Xe*.,1
157,The electronically induced lattice rearrangement of solid Xe was studied by the VUV spectroscopy methods under selective excitation with synchrotron radiation.,9
158,"We used a combination of the luminescence analysis, excitation spectroscopy, and thermally stimulated luminescence.",3
159,The existence of two subbands of molecular luminescence was verified—a defect related component and component originated from the exciton self-trapping in the regular lattice.,4
160,Analysis of the intensity redistribution upon exposure to the VUV light in the range of the exciton absorption enabled us to gain clear evidence for the permanent lattice defect creation  exciton self-trapping into the molecular state.,4
0,Accurate  determination of spectroscopic and thermochemical properties of mono- and dichlorocarbenes,9
1,The best technically feasible values for the triplet–singlet energy gap and the enthalpies of formation of the HCCl and CCl radicals have been determined through the focal-point approach.,5
2,"The electronic structure computations were based on high-level coupled cluster (CC) methods, up to quadruple excitations (CCSDTQ), and large-size correlation-consistent basis sets, ranging from aug-cc-pVDZ to aug-cc-pV6Z, followed by extrapolation to the complete basis set limit.",3
3,"Small corrections due to core correlation, relativistic effects, diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction, as well as harmonic and anharmonic zero-point vibrational energy corrections have been taken into account.",3
4,"The final estimates for the triplet–singlet energy gap, (ã), are 2170 ± 40 cm for HCCl and 7045 ± 60 cm for CCl, favoring the singlet states in both cases.",5
5,Complete quartic force fields in internal coordinates have been computed for both the X̃ and ã states of both radicals at the frozen-core CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ level.,5
6,"Using these force fields vibrational energy levels of {HCCl, DCCl, CCl} up to {6000, 5000, 7000} cm were calculated both by second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) and variationally.",5
7,"These results, especially the variational ones, show excellent agreement with the experimentally determined energy levels.",4
8,"The enthalpies of formation of HCCl (X̃A) and CCl(X̃A), at 0 K, are 76.28 ± 0.20 and 54.54 ± 0.20 kcal mol, respectively.",5
9,Carbenes are among the most important of reactive chemical intermediates.,1
10,Moreover their chemistry is particularly fascinating because their lowest singlet and triplet states are expected to be closely spaced in energy but have quite different chemistries.,1
11,"Therefore a precise determination of the singlet/triplet gap, Δ, is important for understanding reaction mechanisms.",2
12,"For this reason, the determination of these energy gaps has attracted intense interest from quantum chemists and experimentalists alike.",1
13,"This paper will focus upon the study of the singlet/triplet gap of mono- and dichlorocarbene, HCCl and CCl, respectively, by state-of-the-art quantum chemistry techniques.",9
14,It will also report related thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of these molecules.,9
15,There has been a history of both experimental and theoretical studies of chlorocarbenes.,1
16,"Nonetheless as the brief discussion below shows, there are still major discrepancies and unanswered questions.",1
17,"In this work, we strive to produce calculations of Δ for both HCCl and CCl of “near-spectroscopic” accuracy.",0
18,"Moreover, we give reasonable estimates of the expected errors in these calculations.",5
19,These calculations serve to increase the precision of previous calculations significantly.,4
20,"They are also expected to complement experimental work, which ultimately should produce a gold standard of measurement for Δ.",4
21,We believe that our calculations are sufficiently precise to guide in a detailed fashion experimental planning and ultimately to aid the acceptance or rejection of various experimental interpretations of the measured spectra.,4
22,"The first direct spectroscopic observation of HCCl/DCCl in the gas phase was reported in 1966 by Merer and Travis, who have assigned the band system between 550 and 820 nm to the ÃA″ ← X̃A′ transition.",1
23,This pioneering work was followed by numerous spectroscopic studies on the Ã ← X̃ transition both in the gas phase and in Ar matrix.,1
24,All of these studies revealed strong and complicated perturbations caused by the Renner–Teller effect and spin–orbit coupling with the low-lying ãA state.,1
25,"The first data on the X̃ state vibrational levels of HCCl, more specifically the  (HCCl bend) and the  (CCl stretch) fundamentals were provided by matrix isolation infrared (IR) studies.",1
26,"These data were notably complemented by Chang , who have identified six and 11 vibrational levels in the dispersed fluorescence spectra of HCCl and DCCl, respectively.",1
27,A few years later the same group has re-recorded these spectra and assigned 19/24 vibrational levels of HCCl/DCCl in the X̃ state.,1
28,"Besides the rotationally resolved X̃(0,0,1) ← (0,0,0) transition, pure rotational transitions of the X̃(0,0,0) vibrational level have also been observed recently for HCCl and HCCl.",1
29,"The analysis of these spectra resulted in effective rotational constants, centrifugal distortion constants, nuclear quadrupole interaction constants, and spin-rotation constants for these species.",1
30,One of the interesting observations of  was that the spin-rotation constants make a significant contribution to the hyperfine structure due to the relatively low-lying Ã state.,1
31,"The ãA″ − X̃A energy splitting, Δ, was estimated experimentally first by the analysis of the negative ion photoelectron spectrum of HCCl by Lineberger  In their first report they obtained 11 ± 0.3 kcal mol.",1
32,Later they revised this number to 4.2 ± 2.5 kcal mol.,1
33,The analysis of the dispersed fluorescence spectra also resulted in triplet–singlet energy splitting values for HCCl and DCCl.,1
34,"In their first dispersed fluorescence reports Chang , due to the lack of perturbations in the observed X̃ state vibrational levels, determined the low limits of the triplet–singlet energy splitting for HCCl/DCCl as ≈8/11 kcal mol with an error estimate of ±2 kcal mol.",1
35,"In their recently published paper, which presented the analysis of new dispersed fluorescence spectra with much better signal-to-noise ratio, they have not only observed perturbations, but assigned some weak bands to the ãA state.",1
36,"The new, revised Δ values were 6.20 ± 0.05 kcal mol for HCCl and 6.25 ± 0.05 kcal mol for DCCl.",1
37,At present these values seem to be the most dependable experimental estimates of Δ of HCCl.,1
38,The first reliable  study on Δ of HCCl was published by Bauschlicher  in .1977,1
39,"Although these calculations were carried out at a relatively low level of electronic structure theory, the singlet and triplet states were treated in a balanced manner,  Hartree–Fock theory was used for the triplet and the generalized valence bond (GVB 1/2) method for the singlet.",1
40,These calculations resulted in Δ = 1.6 kcal mol.,1
41,"After this work the  prediction of the triplet–singlet gap of HCCl has evolved in the following way: 5.4 kcal mol (1986), {5.8, 6.7, 5.6 ± 0.7, 9.3} kcal mol (1987), {6.0, 6.4 ± 0.7} kcal mol (1990), 6.39 kcal mol (1992), 4.8 kcal mol (1993), 5.8 kcal mol (1996), 6.2 kcal mol (1997), {9.0, 5.7} kcal mol (1999), {0.9–6.6} kcal mol (2000), {6.1, 6.6} kcal mol (2000), {6.1, 6.8, 5.9} kcal mol (2001).",1
42,Considering the most dependable results among these calculations the computational estimate of Δ is 6.4 ± 0.8 kcal mol.,1
43,"The enthalpy of formation, Δ°, of HCCl was obtained experimentally by ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) and collision induced dynamics (CID) techniques, which resulted in 71 ± 5 kcal mol (1985), 75.7 ± 4.8 kcal mol (1994), and 80.4 ± 2.8 kcal mol (1997).",1
44,"All the available quantum chemical calculations are consistent with these results, scattering between 75.3 and 77.4 kcal mol.",1
45,"Among these predictions for Δ° the most reliable, 76.5 ± 1 kcal mol, was obtained by basis set extrapolation of CCSD(T) energies and inclusion of scalar relativistic corrections.",1
46,The first spectroscopic study on CCl was carried out in 1967 in an Ar matrix by Milligan and Jacox.,1
47,"In this matrix isolation IR study the symmetric and the antisymmetric stretching frequencies, 748 and 721 cm for CCl and 726 and 700 cm for CClCl, respectively, were obtained, but without an unambiguous assignment of which is which.",1
48,A year later Andrews performed a similar experiment and assigned the lower of these frequencies to the symmetric stretch ().,1
49,"Some further Ne, Ar, and Kr matrix IR studies have confirmed this assignment, while fluorescence studies in cryogenic matrices resulted in a value for the bending fundamental () of 333 cm in Ar, for the first time.",1
50,"The Ã ← X̃A excitation energies have also been obtained, =17 092 cm in Ar, first from matrix isolation experiments.",1
51,In 1977 Huie  recorded the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) excitation spectrum of the ÃB ← X̃A transition of CCl in the gas phase.,1
52,This was followed by several other gas-phase laser and synchrotron fluorescence excitation studies.,1
53,"Among these probably the most notable are the first rotationally resolved jet-cooled studies of Clouthier and Karolczak, which yielded structural and vibrational parameters of the two lowest-lying singlet states.",1
54,"Since in these works the ground-state vibrational parameters were determined from the observed hot bands of the excitation spectra, these data were substantially refined by the analysis of the recently recorded dispersed fluorescence spectra.",1
55,"These two papers together report 83 and 40 assigned X̃-state vibrational levels for CCl and CClCl, respectively.",1
56,"Two microwave studies on CCl provided not only accurate rotational constants but also centrifugal distortion constants, elements of the complete nuclear quadrupole coupling tensor, and nuclear spin-rotation constants.",1
57,"Similarly to HCCl, the triplet–singlet energy splitting of CCl was first estimated reliably  by Bauschlicher  Including this work the theoretical predictions between 1977 and 1999 started to converge to around 19–23 kcal mol as follows: 13.5 kcal mol (1977), 19.1 kcal mol (1979), 21.9 kcal mol (1985), {21.1, 23.2, 21.6 ± 1.4, 25.9} kcal mol (1987), 20.5 kcal mol (1990), 23.7 kcal mol (1991), 20.0 kcal mol (1992), 23.7 kcal mol (1992), 20.5 ± 1 kcal mol (1993), 19.7 kcal mol (1996), 21.0 kcal mol (1999), and {23.1, 19.6} kcal mol (1999).",1
58,In 1999 Lineberger  have published a report on the photoelectron spectrum of CCl.,1
59,In this work they have determined the triplet–singlet energy splitting of CCl to be 3 ± 3 kcal mol.,1
60,"This has ignited a huge trepidation in the community of theoretically oriented chemists and inspired several groups to perform more accurate theoretical predictions and publish papers on the “surprising difference” or on the “remarkable discrepancy between theory and experiment” including these new estimates for the triplet–singlet splitting: 19.5 ± 2 kcal mol (2000), 20.0 ± 1 kcal mol (2000), {19.2, 20.9} kcal mol (2000), {14.7–21.5} kcal mol (2000), {21.0, 21.5, 19.9} kcal mol (2001), 19.8 kcal mol (2003).",1
61,Ideas have been put forward to reinterpret the “mystery state” of the photoelectron spectrum.,1
62,Lee  suggested that it could be an excited state of the anion or that the discrepancy could come from the errors fitting the Franck–Condon factors.,1
63,"McKee and Michl assumed, and supported it with calculations, that the “mystery” band corresponds to the quartet state of CCl.",1
64,Efforts to obtain a new experimental value for the triplet–singlet energy gap have also been made by analyzing the laser-induced dispersed fluorescence spectrum of CCl.,1
65,"Although the spectrum of CCl has been recorded up to 8500 cm, due to its complexity, , the occurrence of Fermi resonances and an unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio, in the high-energy region it could be fully and unambiguously assigned to X̃-state vibrational levels “only” up to 5000 cm.",1
66,"Hence, only a lower limit of 14 kcal mol could be determined from this experiment.",1
67,"The enthalpy of formation, Δ°, of CCl has been obtained experimentally in numerous ways including kinetic studies, electron impact experiments, ion cyclotron resonance techniques, collision induced dynamics studies, and by determination of the ionization potential.",1
68,"Some of these studies, especially the earlier ones, resulted in values below 50 kcal mol: 47 ± 3 kcal mol (1967), 44 ± 2 kcal mol (1976), 47.8 ± 2 kcal mol (1978), 37 ± 7 kcal mol (1980), 39 ± 3 kcal mol (1985).",1
69,"In contrast to these, other measurements, including the most recent ones scatter between 51 and 57 kcal mol: 56.5 ± 5 kcal mol (1968), 53.8 ± 2 kcal mol (1977), 52.1 ± 3.4 kcal mol (1991), 51.0 ± 2.0 kcal mol (1993), 55.0 ± 2.0 kcal mol (1985).",1
70,All the theoretical results favor the higher value and predict Δ° between 51 and 56 kcal mol.,1
71,The highest-level calculation so far was performed by Demaison  using the Weizmann 2 (W2) model chemistry.,1
72,"In this study 54.48 ± 0.4 kcal mol was obtained for Δ°, which, when combined with other reliable results, gives 54.8 ± 0.4 kcal mol for Δ°.",1
73,For an even more detailed summary of the experimental and theoretical evaluations of the triplet–singlet energy splittings and enthalpies of formation of HCCl and CCl see Tables S1–S4 of the electronic supplementary information (ESI).,1
74,The purpose of this paper is to reduce the uncertainty of the theoretical predictions for the above-discussed spectroscopic and thermochemical properties of the HCCl and CCl radicals by using sophisticated theoretical techniques.,0
75,"Indeed we aim to approach “near-spectroscopic” accuracy, , ±∼50 cm for Δ.",0
76,"After the detailed description of the methodologies applied (Section II), we report in Section III the theoretical determination of the triplet–singlet energy gap [ (ã)] of HCCl and CCl by employing the focal-point approach (FPA).",9
77,Beyond the apparent accuracy of the FPA method its other advantage is that the uncertainty of its final energy predictions can be estimated reliably due to the systematic build-up of its composite calculations.,3
78,In Section IV vibrational energy levels calculated both perturbationally and variationally from an accurate quartic force field representation of the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of HCCl and CCl are presented.,9
79,"It is shown that due to the accuracy of these vibrational calculations they can help the further analysis of the dispersed fluorescence spectra, including the possible identification of the triplet state of CCl.",4
80,"In Section V accurate  determination of the enthalpies of formation, Δ°, of HCCl and CCl is described, utilizing FPA results of this study and related existing high-quality thermochemical data.",9
81,The paper is concluded by a short summary detailing the possible impact of the new theoretical data on subsequent experiments.,1
82,As it is mentioned in the Introduction the electronic structure calculations have been carried out according to the recipe of the so-called focal-point approach documented well in recent publications.,3
83,"Therefore, it is not described here in detail.",1
84,"However, the structure of the rest of this section is organized in a way to follow the major steps of FPA and give insight for a reader not familiar with this approach.",1
85,"The electronic structure calculations reported in this paper have been performed with the help of the ACES II, PSI 2, Gaussian03, and MRCC program packages.",10
86,Reference electronic wave functions have been determined by the single-configuration restricted-open-shell Hartree–Fock (ROHF) method.,6
87,"In the case of CCl the computations have been repeated using an unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF) reference, as well.",10
88,"Electron correlation was accounted for by standard methods of electronic structure theory: second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory, and the coupled cluster (CC) series, including single and double (CCSD), single, double and perturbatively estimated triple [CCSD(T)], single, double and triple (CCSDT), and single, double, triple and quadruple excitations (CCSDTQ).",6
89,"In the valence-only correlated-level calculations the 1s orbital of C and the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals of Cl were kept doubly occupied.",6
90,No virtual molecular orbitals were kept frozen in any of the calculations.,6
91,Relativistic electronic energy corrections were determined by the 1-electron mass-velocity–Darwin (MVD1) and the second-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess [DKH(2)] methods.,6
92,"Corrections beyond the Dirac–Coulomb theory (, the Breit term) and quantum electrodynamics (QED) contributions (Lamb-shift), which supposed to be much smaller than the remaining uncertainty of the non-relativistic calculations, were neglected in this study.",6
93,"Computation of the mass-dependent diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) was performed by the BORN program operating within the PSI 2 program package at the Hartree–Fock level, using the formalism of Handy, Yamaguchi and Schaefer.",10
94,"The one-particle basis sets chosen for the frozen-core correlation calculations include the correlation-consistent (aug)-cc-pVZ,  = 2(D), 3(T), 4(Q), 5, and 6, basis sets developed by Dunning and co-workers.",6
95,"If not noted otherwise, the improved version of these basis sets have been employed for Cl, which include more d-functions than the original version.",10
96,"All-electron correlation calculations have been carried out using the (aug)-cc-pCVZ sets, which are able to describe the core region adequately.",6
97,"Estimation of the complete basis set (CBS) limits have been performed by well-established extrapolation formulas, namely by an exponential formula, =  + exp(−)in the case of HF and an inverse power formula, =  + for both the frozen-core and all-electron correlated energy increments.",6
98,For DBOC energy correction calculations the Dunning–Huzinaga-type DZP and TZ2P basis sets have been used.,6
99,Reference geometries of CCl and HCCl for the single-point energy calculations within the focal-point approach and for the force field calculations have been obtained by geometry optimization at the all-electron CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pCVTZ level of theory.,6
100,The related structural parameters are collected in Table 1.,6
101,"Quartic (and partial sextic) force fields in (stretch, stretch, bend) internal coordinates have been determined by finite differentiation of frozen-core CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ energy values.",6
102,"This level of electronic structure theory was chosen because it represents a well-known Pauling-point in the computational armamentarium, and according to our experience it provides an almost as good local PES as the best state-of-the-art  surfaces ( CBS extrapolated and augmented by auxiliary corrections).",3
103,Vibrational energy levels were computed using formulas based on second-order vibrational perturbational theory (VPT2) and by an approximately variational discrete variable representation (DVR) technique.,6
104,The VPT2 calculations were performed using the ANHARM program package.,10
105,"Since the geometry optimizations and the force field calculations have been performed at different levels of theory, the force fields included non-zero forces.",6
106,"The (stretch, stretch, bend) quartic force fields were first transformed to (SPF, SPF, bend) coordinates, where SPF stands for Simons–Parr–Finlan coordinates, where the forces were neglected, then to Cartesian coordinates, the necessary inputs of ANHARM.",6
107,"The variational calculations were performed with the program DOPI3, where DOPI stands for DVR (D)—Hamiltonian in orthogonal (O) coordinates—direct product (P) basis—iterative (I) sparse Lanczos eigensolver.",10
108,"The PES for the variational calculations was built using force constants in the quartic (SPF, SPF, bend) representation, where the non-zero forces were not neglected in the expansion of the potential.",6
109,The use of the quartic force field in SPF coordinates was chosen because according to previous results (i) employing an SPF representation instead of the simple stretch representation results in better agreement between the variationally computed and the experimental energy levels; and (ii) the quartic and sextic force fields in SPF coordinates result in highly similar energy levels.,3
110,All the vibrational energies presented were converged to better than 0.01 cm.,8
111,In some variational calculations the quintic and sextic diagonal bending internal coordinate force constants have also been included to improve the description of the bending motion.,10
112,All the necessary force field transformations both for the VPT2 and the variational calculations have been carried out with the help of the INTDER program.,10
113,The valence-only FPA results for the triplet–singlet energy splitting of HCCl are summarized in Table 2.,8
114,"From the data presented the following conclusions, similar to those found for CH, can be drawn: (i) Both the extension of the one-particle basis set and the electron correlation treatment systematically lowers the energy of the singlet state with respect to the triplet state.",4
115,"(ii) The HF triplet–singlet energy splitting is fairly independent of the size of the one-particle basis set, it changes only 276 cm between the aug-cc-pVDZ and the CBS limit.",4
116,"Convergence of the higher-order electron correlation contributions, δCCSD(T) and above, with the one-particle basis set is even faster.",4
117,"(iii) The δMP2 and δCCSD contributions converge rather slowly, the change of their absolute value from the aug-cc-pCVDZ basis set to the CBS limit is 977 and 522 cm, respectively.",4
118,(iv) The well-known imbalanced treatment of the two electronic states at the HF level of theory is slowly corrected as the single-reference electron correlation treatment is improved.,4
119,"This is well demonstrated by the extremely large δCCSD(T) contribution, 691 cm at the CBS limit.",4
120,"Nevertheless, the δCCSDTQ increment is comfortably small, +47 cm.",5
121,Our final estimate for the valence-only triplet–singlet energy gap is 2205 ± 35 cm.,5
122,"Furthermore, again similarly to observations for CH, inclusion of core correlation is important, it considerably stabilizes the triplet state with respect to the singlet state (see Table 3).",5
123,"It is also in good correspondence with the observations for CH and other previous studies that, due to the opposite signs of the δCCSD and the δCCSD(T) contributions the MP2 level of theory, with a large enough (, cc-pCVQZ) basis set, estimates well the converged core correlation contribution, which is determined in this study to be −146 ± 20 cm.",4
124,Since the contribution of the relativistic effects is expected to be more important in the case of HCCl than in CH it was computed in a somewhat more careful manner.,3
125,"First, the one-electron scalar contribution was obtained by the MVD1 perturbation method using the ROHF wave function.",3
126,This was then augmented by the difference of the DKH(2) and the MVD1 results calculated also at the ROHF level.,3
127,"Although the two methods approximate the Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian by different partitioning schemes, due to the effective treatment of the first- and second-row elements by these relativistic perturbation techniques this difference basically covers the two-electron scalar and spin–orbit relativistic corrections within the Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian.",1
128,"Finally, the electron correlation contribution to the one-electron scalar terms were obtained as the difference of the ROHF and CCSD(T) MVD1 results.",3
129,"As can be seen from Table 4 the relativistic correction calculated by MVD1 perturbation theory and an ROHF wave function estimates the final result well, both the two-electron and the electron-correlation contributions to the total relativistic correction are small.",5
130,Our final estimate of the relativistic corrections to Δ is +54 ± 10 cm.,4
131,"As expected, the diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) to the triplet–singlet energy gap of HCCl/DCCl is smaller (see Table 5) than it was found for CH.",4
132,"Our best estimate is +10 ± 4 cm and +8 ± 4 cm for HCCl and DCCl, respectively.",4
133,(The isotopologs containing Cl and Cl have the same BODC energy corrections to within 1 cm).,1
134,The zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE) corrections have been computed both by the VPT2 and the variational methods (see Table 6).,3
135,"The total VPT2 ZPE value can be calculated by the following formula:where the three terms are the , the harmonic, and the anharmonic contributions, respectively.",6
136,(A correct analytic formula for the computation of the  term from quartic force fields for asymmetric tops has been derived by Allen ),6
137,"As can be seen from Table 6, the anharmonic and the  contributions to the triplet–singlet energy splitting are only on the order of 1–2 cm.",8
138,"Furthermore, the total VPT2 ZPE correction agrees with the variational results to about 1 cm.",5
139,"Similarly to findings for CH, the ZPE correction is larger for the triplet state, the numerical results for the HCCl and DCCl radicals are 47 and 50 cm, respectively.",5
140,Our error estimate for the ZPE correction is ±5 cm.,5
141,"To obtain the best estimate for  (ã), one sums the lowest, rightmost numbers in Tables 2–4 and the corresponding bottommost numbers in Tables 5 and 6.",3
142,"The resulting values of HCCl and DCCl are 2170 ± 40 cm (6.204 ± 0.114 kcal mol) and 2171 ± 40 cm (6.207 ± 0.114 kcal mol), respectively.",5
143,"These estimates are in an excellent agreement with the recently revised experimental value, 2167/2187 ± 18 cm for HCCl/DCCl, of Chang  On the other hand, the experimentally obtained difference of (ã) of HCCl and DCCl is considerably larger than the theoretically computed difference.",4
144,"A possible source of this apparent discrepancy is the assigned error bar of the experimental observations, which is comparable to the difference of the two (ã) values.",4
145,"An alternative explanation is offered if a relatively large spin–vibronic perturbation existed between the singlet and triplet states, and it is different for the two species.",4
146,"Although this perturbation is not included in our theoretical treatment, the estimation of the magnitude of this perturbation, based on the comparison of the computed and the experimentally observed vibrational levels, will be discussed in Section V.1.",4
147,"Since the technical details and the qualitative observations during determination of the triplet–singlet energy gap of CCl by the FPA were similar to those for CH and HCCl, here we mostly concentrate on the differences and the tendencies in the CH/HCCl/CCl substitution series.",9
148,Convergence of the valence-only energy difference of the singlet and triplet states of CCl with the correlation level is similarly slow (see Table 7) as observed for CH and HCCl.,5
149,"Consequently, to get accurate valence-only estimates higher-order electron correlation contributions have to be determined in this case, as well.",3
150,"At the same time, it is much more demanding to perform higher-order correlation calculations for CCl than for the smaller HCCl and CH systems.",3
151,"Practically we were able to carry out CCSDT calculations only with the aug-cc-pVDZ and the ‘old’ ( one less d orbital on Cl) cc-pVTZ basis set, while CCSDTQ calculations were limited to the ‘old’ cc-pVDZ basis set of Dunning.",8
152,"Although for CH and HCCl we found that the post-CCSD(T) electron-correlation contributions are small, and their CBS values can be estimated relatively accurately using small basis sets, it is desirable to check in an independent way whether the same holds for CCl.",5
153,A well-established way to do this is the comparison of the correlation series using ROHF and UHF references.,3
154,It was found in many cases that the convergence with the correlation level is significantly different in the two cases.,5
155,"In these situations, since both series converge ultimately to the same valence-only limit, the difference of the restricted and unrestricted methods at the same computational level indicates the uncertainty of the calculations due to the neglect of higher-order correlations.",4
156,"In the case of CCl the obtained CBS result for {Δ(HF), Δ(MP2), Δ(CCSD), Δ[CCSD(T)]} is {–22, 6660, 5896, 6997} cm using an ROHF reference (see Table 7), and {–1710, 6922, 5864, 7021} cm when an UHF reference is used.",5
157,"This reveals that in spite of the large deviation, 1688 cm, observed at the HF level, the two CBS CCSD(T) values agree within 24 cm.",5
158,From this we expect that the contribution of the post-CCSD(T) electron correlation is on the order of a few tens of cm.,4
159,"Since this contribution is relatively small and the δCCSD(T) contribution converges relatively fast with the basis set size to CBS limit, it is expected that post-CCSD(T) electron correlation contributions are well estimated by CCSDT and CCSDTQ calculations even using small basis sets.",4
160,"Consequently, we allocate an 50 cm error bar to the 7050 cm valence-only result of the triplet–singlet energy splitting of CCl.",4
161,Inclusion of core correlation (Tables 3 and 8) and relativistic effects (Tables 4 and 9) are becoming more and more important as one goes from the lighter to the heavier species.,5
162,"Together with this the contribution of their cross term, namely the difference between the correlated and non-correlated one-electron scalar relativistic effects, is also increasing.",5
163,This cross term is three times larger in CCl than in HCCl.,8
164,"Our best numerical estimates for the core correlation and the relativistic correction of the triplet–singlet energy gap of CCl are −176 ± 25 cm and +91 ± 15 cm, respectively.",5
165,"As expected, the DBOC contribution (see Table 5) to the triplet–singlet energy gap is decreasing in the CH, HCCl (DCCl), and CCl series.",5
166,"The DBOC contribution, in the case of CCl, is only 5 ± 2 cm.",5
167,"In contrast to this, the ZPE contribution of the total (ã) value, +75 ± 5 cm (see Table 6), of CCl is in between the corresponding values obtained for CH and HCCl/DCCl.",5
168,"The final estimate of this study for (ã) of CCl is obtained by summing the lowest, rightmost numbers in Tables 5–9.",3
169,The resulting value is 7045 ± 60 cm (20.13 ± 0.17 kcal mol).,5
170,"This estimate is in good agreement with other recent  predictions, but the assigned error bar of the theoretical prediction is reduced by an order of magnitude.",4
171,This result further supports the alternative reassignments of the photodetachment spectrum of CCl over the original assignment.,4
172,"The VPT2 vibrational parameters of the X̃ and ã states of HCCl, DCCl, and CCl are listed in Table 10.",8
173,"The vibrational levels obtained by substituting these parameters into the anharmonic oscillator equation of a triatomic molecule,are given in Tables .11–16",5
174,These tables also contain the vibrational levels obtained by variational calculations and from experiments.,5
175,Some further converged variational results as well as results for other isotopologs can be found in the ESI.,8
176,The vibrational energy levels of singlet HCCl and DCCl computed variationally from the quartic force field (see the Var4 columns of Tables 11 and 13) show excellent agreement with the experimentally observed levels up to 3000 cm.,5
177,"The root-mean-square (rms) errors calculated from the first eight and 12 vibrational levels of HCCl and DCCl are 3.6 and 4.5 cm, respectively.",5
178,"Although the corresponding rms errors of the perturbationally obtained energy levels are somewhat larger, 5.4 and 5.9 cm, this still can be considered as a fine performance for a simple, purely theoretical treatment.",4
179,"Above 3000 cm the situation is, however, quite different.",4
180,"The Var4 results for the vibrational energy levels involving small bending quantum numbers still agree very well with the experimental data, while highly excited bending modes show significant (>15 cm) deviation from the experimental observations.",4
181,In order to understand the source of this error we have added the pure fifth- and sixth-order bending force constants to the quartic force field and reran the variational calculations using this augmented force field (see the Var4 columns of Tables 11 and 13).,0
182,"As it is expected, the predicted Var4 and Var4 vibrational energy levels are the same within 1 cm for modes with small  vibrational quantum numbers.",5
183,"On the other hand, the Var4 and Var4 results for highly excited bending modes are rather different, the Var4 energy levels are 15–40% closer to the experimental values than the corresponding Var4 ones.",5
184,"The importance of the inclusion of the higher order bending force constants is connected to the fact that the barrier to linearity of HCCl in its X̃ state is relatively low, 17 766 cm at the all-electron CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pCVTZ level.",4
185,"Somewhat surprisingly the perturbational predictions, which of course utilize the quartic force fields only, are better for the highly excited bending modes than the variational results.",4
186,"Nevertheless, this seems to be a consequence of fortuitous cancellation of errors in this region, since the errors of the perturbationally obtained vibrational energy levels of modes with low bending excitation have opposite signs.",4
187,In  Chang  discussed the spin–vibronic coupling and the perturbation between certain vibrational levels of the X̃ and ã states.,1
188,"They have estimated the magnitude of these perturbations by the difference between the experimentally determined vibrational levels and the vibrational levels calculated from fitted effective spectroscopic parameters, when only the unperturbed levels were included in the preceding fit.",1
189,"In this paper we estimate these spin–vibronic perturbations a similar way, but instead of the fitted expansion we use the Var4 results.",3
190,"Although the variationally obtained vibrational levels have somewhat larger errors than the levels obtained by the use of the fitted expansion, determination of the perturbations from the variational results has certain advantages.",3
191,"First, one does not need to consider prior to the fit which levels are perturbed and which are not and hence all appropriate levels can be considered.",3
192,"Second, the variational method, unlike the second-order expansion of the anharmonic oscillator model, treats exactly the resonances between the vibrational levels belonging to the same electronic state.",3
193,"Finally, it is noted that larger errors can be by-passed if they are systematic for a given series.",3
194,"Chang  pointed out large perturbations with given ã-state vibrational levels for the X̃(0,2,0), X̃(0,2,1), and X̃(0,2,2) vibrational levels of HCCl and for the X̃(0,4,0) and the X̃(0,4,1) levels of DCCl.",1
195,"From our calculations the errors of the Var4 results for the X̃(0,,0) energy levels of HCCl (Table 11) are {+5, −2, +8, +11} cm for ={1,2,3,4}.",5
196,"If the trend in the errors is systematic, one would expect a +6 – +7 cm error for the X̃(0,2,0) mode.",5
197,"From this we can deduce an 8–9 cm perturbation between the X̃(0,2,0) level at 2383 cm (experimental, Table 11) and the close-lying ã(0,0,0) level at 2167 cm (experimental).",5
198,"This perturbation lowers the energy of ã(0,0,0), in other words the unperturbed (ã) of HCCl is larger than the experimentally observed value.",5
199,Consequently the difference (see Section III.1) between the experimentally determined (20 cm) and the calculated (1 cm) difference of the (ã) of HCCl and DCCl would be slightly smaller if the computed values included spin–vibronic interactions.,4
200,"In a similar way, considering the error series of the calculated X̃(0,,1) vibrational levels ({0, +3, −4, +4} for  = 0,1,2,3), a smaller, roughly +4 cm energy increase would be obtained for the X̃(0,2,1) vibrational level at 3181 cm (experimental, Table 11) due to the interaction with the ã(0,1,0) and/or the ã(0,0,1) vibrational levels at 3050 cm and 3110 cm (experimental (ã) + Var4 vibrational level), respectively.",4
201,"It is evident that the X̃(0,2,2) level of HCCl at 3976 cm can be perturbed by the close-lying ã(0,2,0) and the ã(0,1,1) vibrational levels at 3915 cm and 3983 cm (experimental (ã) + Var4 vibrational level), respectively.",4
202,"Unfortunately, the fourth member of the X̃(0,,2) series already falls in the region where the accuracy of the variational calculations is not sufficient to be included in the error series.",4
203,"From the fist three members, {−3, −6, −17}, of this error series only a very rough estimate of the perturbation effects can be determined, for X̃(0,2,2), 6–10 cm.",4
204,"Similarly to this, both the X̃(0,4,0) and the X̃(0,4,1) levels of DCCl fall in the energy region where the accuracy of the present variational calculations starts to deteriorate, consequently no reliable estimate of the perturbation effects can be determined based on the present data.",4
205,"There are no experimental data available on the vibrational energy levels of triplet HCCl, and only two vibrationally excited energy levels in the ã state of DCCl were observed experimentally.",1
206,For these two vibrational levels of DCCl the calculated data and the experimental values agree to within 6–15 cm.,5
207,"Again, this discrepancy, at least partially, might be caused by spin–vibronic interaction between the singlet and triplet states.",4
208,"As expected, the variationally calculated vibrational levels of singlet CCl show an even better agreement with the experimental observations than it was found for HCCl and DCCl.",5
209,"Comparing the Var4 energy levels up to 4000 cm to the experimental data of Liu  results in an rms error of 2.6 cm, which is even less than the assigned uncertainty, ±3 cm, of the experimental data.",5
210,"The deviation of the Var4 results from the experimental data set of Kable  is somewhat worse, the rms error is 6.9 cm for the same region.",5
211,"The rms error calculated from comparing the Liu  data set with the VPT2 results is even larger, it is 9.7 cm.",5
212,"In the former case the larger rms error is probably due to the lower precision of the experimental data set, while in the latter case it is the consequence of the less accurate theoretical treatment, , perturbational . variational, of the nuclear motion problem.",4
213,"As it is expected, no perturbation due to spin–vibronic interaction with the triplet state can be found up to 4000 cm, since the calculated triplet–singlet energy gap is well above this energy region.",5
214,"Although further converged Var4 results are available in the ESI, due to the high density of vibrational levels above 4000 cm the assignment of these energy states to given vibrational quantum numbers is ambiguous without detailed wave function analysis.",4
215,This was omitted in the present study.,1
216,The calculated vibrational levels of triplet CCl are summarized in Table 15.,5
217,"Considering the excellent performance of the Var4 results for the singlet state, the predictions for the triplet state are expected to be similarly good, which could help the further analysis of the experimental data, including the determination of (ã).",4
218,Some suggested directions for future experiments utilizing these computed data will be discussed briefly in Section VI.,1
219,"Utilizing the high-quality  results described above, the enthalpies of formation of HCCl(X̃A′) and CCl(X̃A) at 0 K have been determined by calculating the enthalpy change of the reactionsCH(ãA) + HCl(X̃Σ) → HCCl(X̃A′) + H(X̃Σ)andCH(ãA) + 2HCl(X̃Σ) → CCl(X̃A) + 2 H(X̃Σ)",6
220,"For the enthalpies of formation of HCl(X̃Σ), H(X̃Σ), and CH(ãA), required to evaluate Δ° (HCCl) and Δ° (CCl), see Table 17.",6
221,The advantages of this procedure over calculating the appropriate atomization energies lies in that (i) the contribution of the spin–orbit effect can be neglected since it is much smaller for a non-linear open-shell species than for an atom; and (ii) the errors due to neglecting higher-order correlation effects ( δCCSDTQP) is expected to cancel out in a proper reaction scheme.,3
222,"The enthalpy of formation of HCCl(X̃A′) at 0 K, Δ (HCCl), calculated from the enthalpy change of reaction (5) and Δ of CH(ãA), HCl(X̃Σ), and H(X̃Σ) is 76.28 kcal mol.",5
223,Due to the abovementioned error compensation of the total energy of CH(ãA) and HCCl(X̃A′) the enthalpy change of reaction (5) is expected to be estimated to better than ±0.1 kcal mol.,5
224,A larger part of the uncertainty of the present calculation comes from the uncertainty of Δ° of CH(ãA) and a smaller portion from the uncertainty of Δ° of HCl(X̃Σ).,4
225,"Since these uncertainties are ±0.16 and ±0.024 kcal mol, respectively, we allocate a ±0.20 kcal mol uncertainty to our final value of Δ° (HCCl).",4
226,"Utilizing the calculated thermal correction, Δ° − Δ° = 0.07 kcal mol, of . results in 76.35 ± 0.20 kcal mol for Δ° of HCCl(X̃A′).",5
227,"The uncertainty of the present result is smaller by a factor of five than the uncertainty of the former highest-level calculation, and more than an order of magnitude smaller than the values obtained by experiments or reported in the available thermochemical databases.",4
228,"The enthalpy of formation of CCl(X̃A) at 0 K, Δ° (CCl), calculated through Reaction (6), is 54.54 kcal mol.",5
229,From considerations analogues to those given in Section V.1. the uncertainty of this value is ±0.20 kcal mol.,5
230,The thermal correction of the enthalpy of formation of CCl(X̃A) can be obtained as follows: Δ° − Δ°[CCl] (X̃A)] = { − [CCl(X̃A)]} − {−[C]} − {[Cl (X̃Σ)]} = {2.737} − {2.194} − {0.251} kcal mol = 0.292 kcal mol.,6
231,"This value is equal to the calculated value of , and it results in 54.83 ± 0.20 kcal mol for Δ° of CCl(X̃A).",5
232,"The present result is in excellent agreement with the recent W2 computation of Demaison  Furthermore, due to the inclusion of higher-order correlation effects in its computation in this study and utilization of a reaction scheme instead of atomization energies it was possible to reduce the uncertainty of the theoretical predictions by a factor of two.",4
233,"Note that the present value, as well as recently published theoretical values, have at least an order of magnitude smaller uncertainty than the values given in the available thermochemical databases.",4
234,In this paper the best technically feasible values for the triplet–singlet energy gap of the HCCl/DCCl and CCl radicals have been determined through the focal-point approach.,5
235,"The final estimates for the triplet–singlet energy gap, (ã), are 2170 ± 40/2171 ± 40 cm for HCCl/DCCl and 7045 ± 60 cm for CCl.",5
236,"The estimate for HCCl is in very good agreement with the recently revised experimental value, 2167/2187 ± 18 cm for HCCl/DCCl, of Chang , while the estimate for CCl supports alternative reassessments of the photodetachment spectrum of CCl over the original assignment, as well as the experimental lower limit value of (ã) suggested by Liu",4
237,Complete quartic force fields in internal coordinates have been computed for both the X̃ and ã states of both radicals at the frozen-core CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ level.,5
238,Using these force fields vibrational energy levels were computed both by second-order vibrational perturbation theory and variationally.,5
239,"These results, especially the variational ones, show excellent agreement with the experimentally determined energy levels.",4
240,The accuracy of these calculations and the systematic behavior of errors of vibrational progressions allowed us to determine the extent of perturbations due to spin–vibronic coupling between singlet and triplet vibrational levels of HCCl.,4
241,"In agreement with Chang , significant perturbations, as much as 4–12 cm are observed for the X̃(0,2,0), X̃(0,2,1), and X̃(0,2,2) vibrational levels.",4
242,"From the accurate theoretical values the enthalpies of formation of HCCl(X̃A′) and CCl(X̃A) were determined at 0 K, which are 76.28 ± 0.20 and 54.54 ± 0.20 kcal mol, respectively.",5
243,These results are in good agreement with other recent calculations.,4
244,"Furthermore, the uncertainties of the present results are smaller by a factor of 2–5 than the uncertainties of even the best of the former theoretical values, and more than an order of magnitude smaller than Δ° given in the available thermochemical databases.",4
245,It is worthwhile checking if the available dispersed fluorescence spectrum above 7000 cm (see Fig. 1) is consistent or inconsistent with the computed (ã) and the ã state vibrational levels of CCl.,4
246,"Within the error bar of the theoretically determined (ã), three–four peaks can be assigned to the vibrational origin of the triplet state; namely, A: 6954 ± 5 cm, B: 7012 ± 5 cm, C: 7033 ± 5 cm, and D: 7071 ± 10 cm.",5
247,Marking the calculated triplet state  vibrational progressions (and the first  level) in the same figure (Fig. 1) it is apparent that progressions starting from peaks A and B match the other peaks of the spectrum best.,5
248,"Since peak A is slightly out of the error bar of the computed (ã), peak B becomes the most probable candidate for the ã(0,0,0) energy level.",4
249,"Of course, this assignment should be considered only very preliminary and tentative.",4
250,It really just demonstrates that there are transitions in this spectral region consistent with the presence of the ã state.,4
251,It is unlikely that these transitions are attributable to highly excited X̃ vibrational levels due to the poor Franck–Condon factors involved.,4
252,"Because of the high density of states in this region, spectra obtained at higher resolution and with better signal-to-noise ratio could notably facilitate arguments about the assignment.",4
253,Another problem making the above assignment ambiguous is related to spin–vibronic coupling.,4
254,"If the coupling is too small, the emissions to triplet state levels might not appear in the dispersed fluorescence spectrum at all.",4
255,"On the other hand, if the coupling is large, the triplet state vibrational levels computed using the triplet-state PES only could be significantly different from their experimental counterparts.",4
256,"Hence, it would be advisable to utilize other experiments to determine (ã) of CCl.",4
257,"Since the bond angles, and consequently the rotational constants are remarkably different in the singlet and triplet states (see Table 1), one possibility would be to record the rotationally resolved stimulated emission pumping (SEP) spectrum of CCl.",4
258,"Another possibility would be to record the absorption spectrum, , by the cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) technique.",4
259,"In this case the high-energy X̃ state vibrational overtones ( > 20 or  > 10) are not expected to appear in the spectrum, while the intensity of the triplet state levels is determined by the spin–vibronic coupling.",4
260,After submission of the paper we have received a manuscript from H.-G.,1
261,"Xu, T. Sears and J. T. Muckerman entitled “Potential energy surfaces and vibrational energy levels of DCCl and HCCl in three low-lying states”.",1
262,The MRCI calculations reported in this paper are in good agreement with our results.,1
263,"The only smaller difference between our and their results is in the numerical value (4  22 cm, respectively) of the perturbation between the ã(0,1,0) and X̃(0,2,1) levels of HCCl.",1
0,"Vibrational relaxation dynamics of ICl(, ′) induced by low-temperature collisions with He atoms",9
1,"Using laser-induced fluorescence and two-laser, pump–probe spectroscopy, collision-induced vibrational relaxation is observed to compete with the dissociation of electronically excited ICl in a helium carrier gas expansion.",5
2,"By thoroughly characterizing the expansion properties, we observe that collisions of ICl(, ′ = 3) molecules with He atoms in the expansion induce vibrational relaxation of the initially prepared dihalogen down to rotor states in the next lower ICl(,′ = 2) level on timescales that compete with the rate for non-adiabatic transfer from the  state to the 1 state.",5
3,"The resulting ICl(,′ = 2,′) product rotational distribution, along with the analogous ICl(,′ = 1,′) distribution formed by collisional relaxation of molecules in the long-lived ICl(,′ = 2) level are compared to ICl(,′ = 2,′) products formed by vibrational predissociation of He⋯ICl complexes prepared in different intermolecular vibrational levels within the He + ICl(,′ = 3) potential.",4
4,"No evidence is observed for resonance-enhanced collisional cross sections, even at the low temperatures achieved,  < 1.0 K.",5
5,A fundamental goal of reaction dynamicists is to develop an understanding of a bimolecular encounter on the state-to-state level.,1
6,"While this is particularly true for reactive systems, insights into the dynamics and mechanisms guiding energy transfer in non-reactive partners are also desirable.",1
7,"With this goal in mind, groups have undertaken investigations into the collision dynamics of several systems, some of which include rare-gas atoms with halogen molecules, especially helium atoms with molecular iodine, I.",1
8,These rare gas–dihalogen systems have the advantage of being both experimentally and theoretically feasible.,1
9,"Experimentally, the dynamics are simplified within a supersonic expansion in which low temperatures, and consequently small initial-state distributions, are easily attainable.",1
10,"Also, the halogens have a low-lying electronic state, the Π state, with multiple vibrational levels that can be easily accessed.",1
11,"The He + I system has received extra attention in these studies because of the significant absorption cross section of I in the visible wavelength region, and because it was noted near the advent of supersonic beam methods that there is a large cross section for collisions of He atoms to induce vibrational relaxation of I(,′).",1
12,"Since then, a debate has ensued over the role that orbiting resonances, or weakly-bound collision complexes, have in the collisional relaxation of I(,′).",1
13,An initial report suggested that orbiting resonances were the primary contributor to the large vibrational relaxation cross sections observed.,1
14,"Subsequent papers have suggested, however, that resonances need not be invoked to explain the large cross sections.",1
15,"These papers do acknowledge, however, that even though resonances are not required to explain the results, they could still be contributing to the observed behavior.",1
16,"Because of this, the debate is still considered by some to be open.",1
17,"A special subset of the experiments examining the collisional-relaxation dynamics of halogen molecules with rare gas atoms involves dissociation of rare gas–dihalogen van der Waals complexes, Rg⋯XY.",1
18,The dissociation of these complexes is often thought of as a half-collision event because it mimics the second half of a collision that occurs at a specified intermolecular geometry.,1
19,"However, while numerous papers have been published on the dissociation dynamics of Rg⋯XY van der Waals complexes both by experimentalists and theoreticians, surprisingly little effort has been spent connecting the half-collision and full-collision regimes.",1
20,"Presumably, this is because until recently the dynamics of Rg⋯XY complexes were only observed from one geometry, that of the T-shaped intermolecular orientation.",1
21,"Recent work by our group, however, has shown that different conformers of Rg⋯XY complexes can be stabilized within a supersonic expansion.",1
22,"Furthermore, these conformers have different Franck–Condon windows, enabling access to different excited-state intermolecular vibrational levels.",1
23,A recent publication on He⋯ICl has shown that excitation to these different intermolecular vibrational levels gives rise to different vibrational predissociation dynamics due in large part to the region of the intermolecular potential that is populated.,1
24,The experiments that are described in this manuscript were undertaken to identify the relaxation dynamics induced by collisions of a He carrier gas with ICl excited in the – spectral region within a supersonic expansion.,0
25,The larger rotor constant of ICl in comparison to that of I permits rotational populations to be accurately determined.,3
26,"A combination of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and two-color, pump–probe experiments are performed in conjunction with a systematic interrogation of the spectra recorded using different expansion conditions to shed light on these energy transfer processes.",0
27,The full-collision data can be analyzed to determine whether evidence exists for resonance-enhanced cross sections for collisions of ICl with He at low temperatures.,3
28,"Also, the dynamics of the full-collision events are conveniently compared to those of the half-collision dynamics that were recently reported for vibrational predissociation of He⋯ICl van der Waals complexes from varying energy regions within the He + ICl(,′ = 3) intermolecular potential energy surface (PES).",3
29,These experiments were performed in a similar manner as reported previously.,10
30,The ICl was seeded in a carrier gas by passing the gas over a vessel of solid ICl maintained at 274 K. A pure helium carrier gas was used unless otherwise noted.,10
31,"The ICl/carrier gas mixture was pulsed through an orifice with a diameter, , of 890(30) μm at 10 Hz into a vacuum chamber maintained at pressures <2.7 × 10 bar during an experiment using a roots blower mechanical pumping system.",10
32,"The pulsed valve and the supply lines, except for the sample reservoir, were kept at room temperature, . 294 K. The collision frequencies and densities in the expansion region were varied by utilizing different carrier-gas backing pressures within the range of 3.8 to 28.6 bar.",10
33,"Regions with different local temperatures within the expansion, as well as varying densities and collision frequencies, were sampled by adjusting the downstream distance at which the laser axis intersected the supersonic expansion; most of these experiments were performed at downstream distances, , ranging from 5.0 to 25.0 mm, or  = 5.6 to 28.1.",10
34,"A commercial dye laser, pumped by the 532 nm output of a 10 Hz, Nd:YAG laser, was used in LIF spectroscopy experiments.",10
35,"The laser pulse energies for most of the scans performed in the ICl –, 2–0 and 3–0 region (560 to 567 nm) were . 20 mJ after the beam was spatially filtered to a diameter of 3 mm.",10
36,The frequency resolution of the dye laser was measured to be 0.06–0.07 cm.,8
37,Fluorescence was detected by imaging the interaction region of the laser with the expansion onto a photomultiplier tube (PMT)  a mirror and telescope assembly.,10
38,"The fluorescence was filtered spatially using a 16.5 mm × 2.8 mm mask, with the long axis positioned parallel to the expansion, so that only fluorescence from the center, coldest region of the expansion was detected by the PMT.",10
39,"The current signal from the PMT was amplified, integrated and averaged with a boxcar-gated integrator, and recorded as a function of laser wavelength.",10
40,"The rotational contour of the ICl –, 2–0 LIF band was fit using known spectroscopic constants in order to determine the Boltzmann rotational temperature representative of the ICl(,″ = 0) ground state level, , in each set of experiments.",10
41,"This is critical since  is dependent on the precise expansion conditions utilized, specifically the downstream distance that the laser crosses the expansion and, to a lesser extent, the backing pressure of the carrier gas.",10
42,"In addition, the mechanical opening of the solenoid pulsed valve varied slightly on a day-to-day basis and, as a result, the pulsed valve widths and the temporal delay between the opening of pulsed valve and the firing of the laser were optimized for each set of experiments.",10
43,"Slight deviations in the ICl(,″ = 0) rotational temperatures were found with these timing changes even when all other conditions were kept constant.",10
44,"For two-color, pump–probe experiments, the laser system described above was used as the pump laser, and a second commercial Nd:YAG (355 nm) pumped dye laser was used as the probe laser.",10
45,"The bandwidth was 0.06 cm, and neutral density filters were used to lower the laser pulse energies so that saturation effects were minimized; we found that pulse energies as low as 30 μJ were needed to avoid saturating individual rotational lines in the strong ICl –, –′ product spectra.",10
46,A dichroic mirror was used to co-propagate the pump and probe laser beams through the expansion region.,10
47,The temporal delay between the pump and probe lasers was typically 15 to 20 ns with a pulse-to-pulse timing jitter of ±1 ns.,10
48,A UG-1 filter was used to block laser scatter from both the pump and probe lasers and to minimize the detection of intense ICl  →  emission induced by the pump laser.,10
49,"High-resolution LIF spectra of ICl entrained in a He supersonic expansion were recorded in the ICl –, 2–0 and 3–0 spectral regions, Fig. 1a and b, respectively.",10
50,"These spectra were recorded using a He-backing pressure of 14.8 bar, at  = 11.9, and with the same laser pulse energies and PMT settings so that the relative intensities of the spectral features observed in both spectra can be compared.",10
51,"The spectrum recorded in the ICl –, 2–0 region was reported previously in Fig. 1 of  but is plotted again in Fig. 1a for clarity of the discussion in these studies.",8
52,"This spectrum is dominated by the ICl and ICl monomer bands near 17 659 and 17 664 cm, respectively.",8
53,To higher energy than the monomer bands are spectroscopic features attributed to transitions of He⋯ICl complexes with T-shaped and linear equilibrium orientations in the ground state to different intermolecular vibrational levels in the excited state.,5
54,The intensities of the He⋯ICl features are . 100 times weaker than the ICl monomer bands.,8
55,(Note the ×100 magnification of the fluorescence intensity scale for transition energies >17 665 cm).,8
56,"The LIF spectrum recorded in the ICl –, 3–0 region, Fig. 1b, was also published previously, Fig. 2 of , and is dominated by features attributed to transitions of the T-shaped and linear He⋯ICl(,″ = 0) complexes.",5
57,"The weak features near 17 821 and 17 828 cm correspond to transitions of the ICl(,″ = 0) monomers to the short-lived ICl(,′ = 3,′) rotational states.",5
58,"Based upon previous experimental investigations, the low ICl(,′ = 3,′) rotor states accessed in these transitions have lifetimes on the order of 0.5 ns due to the presence of a nearby repulsive curve, the  1 state.",1
59,"However, because our integration gate is delayed 150 ns after the laser, ICl  → , 3 → ″ fluorescence is not detected.",5
60,"Previously reported pump–probe experiments indicate that the ICl –, 3–0 LIF features are observed as a result of a mechanism that populates rotational states of the long-lived ICl(,′ = 2) vibrational level following the preparation of rotor states in the short-lived ICl(,′ = 3) level.",1
61,"The rotational structure within the ICl –, 3–0 LIF features is accurately simulated using published ground and excited-state rotational constants and term values.",1
62,"These features, therefore, cannot be attributed to transitions originating from bound He⋯ICl(,″ = 0) intermolecular vibrational levels or from weakly interacting He + ICl(,″ = 0) collision complexes that would have different rotational contours than those observed.",5
63,"In order to best characterize the dynamics and mechanism of the collision processes occurring in the expansion, special attention was focused on characterizing the local environment within the supersonic expansion and on tracking the experimental observables as a function of the expansion conditions.",0
64,"These measurements are used to estimate the physical parameters associated with the collisions of He atoms with ICl(,′ = 3,′) molecules that compete with the non-adiabatic dissociation dynamics of the excited-state molecules.",3
65,"Finally, a comparison of the full-collision measurements with half-collision dynamics of He⋯ICl(,′ = 3) complexes will be made.",0
66,Extensive experimental and theoretical investigations have been undertaken to characterize the properties of atoms and molecules within isentropic supersonic expansions.,1
67,"The thermodynamics for a perfect gas require the temperature , pressure , and density , within the expansion region to be related by/ = (/) = (/),where , , and  represent the temperature, pressure, and density of the reservoir gas behind the nozzle, and  is the heat capacity ratio, /, or 5/3 for a monatomic gas.",6
68,"These quantities can be related to the Mach number, , and consequently the distance downstream in nozzle diameters, , by/ = [1 +  ( – 1)/2], where  =  () ,where  is a constant, 3.26 for a monatomic gas expansion.",6
69,Eqn (2) is only valid for the region within an expansion where the two-body collision frequency is sufficient for continued cooling.,6
70,"Previous experiments performed in our laboratory indicate that collisions of He atoms with ICl(,″ = 0) molecules and He⋯ICl(,″ = 0) complexes occur at downstream distances of at least  = 69, and thus eqns (1) and (2) would be expected to hold for regions in the expansion up to this distance.",6
71,The local temperatures associated with each  at which LIF spectra were recorded are calculated using eqn (2).,10
72,"These temperatures, , are shown in Fig. 2 as open squares, as are the ICl(,″ = 0) Boltzmann rotational temperatures , that were experimentally determined by fitting the rotational contour of the ICl –, 2–0 LIF band, black squares.",8
73,"There is poor agreement between the values of  and , especially at low , as  is more than a factor of two greater than  up to  = 14.0.",5
74,"A fit of the experimental data indicates that the functional form of eqn (2) is appropriate only with a larger value for the constant , 5.28(5), black line in Fig. 2.",5
75,Similar behavior has been reported for a He/I expansion using a slit nozzle.,1
76,"As noted previously, the reason for the discrepancy may be that for He expansions the terminal Mach number reached is much larger than that predicted using classical equations.",4
77,"The intermolecular translational energy that arises from the different terminal velocities of the seeded molecules and the carrier-gas atoms in an expansion gives rise to another temperature value, , that is not necessarily represented by either  or .",6
78,"The difference in the velocities along the expansion direction results from the different masses of the species and is referred to as a velocity slip, with the heavier species travelling more slowly than the lighter species.",6
79,"The ICl molecules in a He expansion are thus predicted to be travelling slower than the lighter He atoms, and collisions between the two species will occur with a temperature of .",7
80,"Furthermore, each species in the expansion will have a different velocity distribution, which can be characterized by a translational temperature, .",6
81,"The distribution of the lighter species is broader than that of the heavier species, which will also contribute to the slip between the light and heavy species in the expansion.",6
82,"In order to estimate a value for the velocity slip between the ICl molecules and the He atoms in the expansion as well as the velocity distribution of the ICl molecules, we have directly measured the time-of-flight of excited-state ICl* molecules that is needed to travel a fixed distance along the expansion using a pump–probe experimental scheme.",0
83,"The pump laser was fixed at the wavelength of the ICl –, 2–0 bandhead, at 17 664 cm, and the probe laser was fixed on the ICl –, 11–2 bandhead, 23 066 cm.",10
84,"The laser beams were spatially filtered down to . 1 mm diameters, and a 0.5 m focal length lens was inserted after the iris to focus the lasers to diameters of . 320 and . 180 μm for the pump and probe lasers, respectively, in the expansion region.",10
85,The probe laser was aligned so that it crossed the expansion 3.5(1) mm downstream from the pump laser.,10
86,"The intensity of the ICl  → , 11 → ″ fluorescence induced by the probe laser was then monitored as a function of the temporal delay between the pump and probe lasers.",10
87,"The maximum probe signal was observed at a temporal delay of 2.00 μs with the pump laser crossing the expansion 9.9 mm downstream from the pulsed valve orifice,  = 11.1, when using a backing pressure of 14.8 bar.",8
88,This time delay corresponds to an ICl velocity of . 1750(50) m s.,5
89,"The measurement was repeated with the pump laser set at 21.7 mm downstream,  = 24.4, and with backing pressures of 7.9 and 14.8 bar, and the same velocity was obtained in all measurements.",5
90,"Within the experimental error, this value is the same as both the terminal velocity of pure He in a supersonic expansion, 1760 m s, and the mass weighted terminal velocity of 360 ppm ICl in a He expansion, 1747 m s.",4
91,"Consequently, we can only deduce an upper limit for the velocity slip between the ICl molecules and the He atoms of 60 m s.",4
92,"This velocity would correspond to  < 0.6 K, suggesting that  may be either within or below the range of , 0.19 to 3.0 K. Consequently, we do include  in some of the analyses described below to investigate what contribution the velocity slip may have on the observed dynamics.",4
93,"We also attempted to estimate the velocity distribution of the ICl molecules in the expansion by recording the temporal breadth of the pump–probe delay signals recorded as described above and with the pump laser at  = 11.1 and 24.4, and with backing pressures of 7.9 and 14.8 bar.",0
94,"The temporal breadth of the pump–probe signals in all the measurements was approximately the same, . 0.22 μs, and appears to be limited by the diameters of the focused lasers in the expansion region.",5
95,"Thus, we do not include effects from the velocity distribution in the analyses below.",4
96,"Since  is the most reliable measurement of the expansion temperature for our current apparatus, and  is known to be an upper limit for the equilibrium temperature, , is used in eqn (1) to approximate the total density (He atoms and ICl molecules)  at each distance in the expansion.",6
97,"As will be shown below, the general trend observed of decreasing ICl density as a function of  is reproduced using  in eqn (1).",5

99,The calculated total densities range from 3.8 × 10 cm at  = 5.8 down to 0.6 × 10 cm at  = 14.0.,5
100,"The densities of the ground state ICl(,″ = 0) molecules  are then estimated by multiplying  by the partial pressure of ICl in a He carrier gas, . 360 ppm at 14.8 bar and 274 K, and by the isotopic abundance of the ICl isotope, 0..7577",6
101,"The resultant estimates of  vary from 1.0 × 10 cm at  = 5.8 down to 1.6 × 10 cm at  = 14.0, as shown in Fig. 3 as open squares.",5

103,Several models and methods have been implemented in calculations of the collision frequencies of molecules with carrier gas atoms within supersonic expansions.,1
104,"The simplistic equation for collisions between hard spheres is most often implemented to estimate order-of-magnitude collision frequencies of a molecule A with carrier gas atoms B: = π2AB (8/π)The collision diameter  is taken to be the average of the diameters of A and B,  = ½( + ).",6

108,"We also assume  = 3.7 Å, based on approximations of atomic He and molecular ICl diameters.",6
109,"Calculations of the He + ICl(,′ = 2) PES indicate that this approximation may be a slight overestimate for .",6
110,Examining a slice through the T-shaped orientation reveals a hard-sphere radius of 3.34 Å.,5
111,"However, considering that collisions will occur at multiple orientations, including the linear orientation, which has a longer hard-sphere radius than the T-shaped orientation, we believe that  = 3.7 Å is a reasonable estimate.",4
112,"Using this value, we calculate hard-sphere collision frequencies ranging from 2.2 × 10 collisions s at  = 5.8 down to 2.7 × 10 collisions s at  = 14.0.",5
113,"Previous studies have shown, however, that for the low temperatures prevalent in a free-jet expansion a hard-sphere model is not appropriate.",1
114,"Because of the low temperatures, a potential incorporating an attractive term gives much more reasonable estimates of collision frequencies.",1
115,One such model that has worked well is the Lennard-Jones 6–12 potential.,3
116,"The Lennard-Jones 6–12 model is especially convenient because the collision frequency, , can be related to the hard sphere collision frequency, , using published  collision integrals:  = The collision integrals have been tabulated as a function of the reduced temperature, *, where* = /and  corresponds to the well depth of the potential.",3
117,"The values of the collision integrals in  only extend to * = 0.3; however, lower values of * have been reported by Knight and co-workers.",1
118,We use here a fit of Knight’s reported values to determine the  values that correspond to our experimentally determined values for .,0
119,"We take the Lennard-Jones well depth, , to be equal to that of the calculated He + ICl(,′ = 3) PES, 32 cm in the T-shaped orientation; the potential will be more shallow at other collision geometries.",6

121,The assumption that  =  will be qualitatively justified in the following section.,1
122,"Using the aforementioned equations for density and collision frequency, eqns (1), (3), and (4), as well as the characterization of the temperature of the expansion, we can model the downstream-distance and backing-pressure dependences of the intensities of the ICl –, 2–0 and 3–0 features in an attempt to gain insight into the collision dynamics that give rise to the observed signals.",0
123,"The LIF spectra recorded in the ICl –, 2–0 and 3–0 regions at several distances downstream are used to characterize the dependence of the ICl –, 3–0 band intensity on carrier gas density and ICl–He collision frequency.",3

126,"Weighted fits of the data to power dependencies were made to provide a guide for the experimental trends of the intensities, shown as solid lines.",3
127,The data points and the fits were normalized by dividing each data point by the value of the fit at  = 5.8.,3
128,"The intensities of the ICl –, 2–0 and 3–0 bands decay monotonically with increasing distance with the 3–0 band decaying more rapidly than the 2–0 band.",5

130,"2, and, as a result, we use the intensity of the ICl –, 2–0 band to monitor changes in the ICl(,″ = 0) ground-state density.",5
131,"Note that some collisional relaxation of ICl(,′ = 2) to ICl(,′ = 1) does occur, but this represents only . 1% of the ICl molecules excited.",5
132,"Any ICl signals that arise from collisions of the ICl molecules with He atoms should be proportional to the product of the ICl–He collision frequency and the ICl density, *, at each downstream distance.",6
133,"These products are fit to a power dependence, lower dashed curve in Fig. 3, and normalized using the value of the fit at the shortest , open circles.",6
134,"Strong agreement between the integrated intensity of the ICl –, 3–0 band, filled circles, and *, open circles, is observed in Fig. 3.",8
135,"The agreement of * with the ICl –, 3–0 band is reasonable but not quite as good as the agreement with *.",8
136,This indicates that the Lennard-Jones potential is a slightly better model for calculating collision frequencies than the simplistic hard-sphere potential.,5
137,"Furthermore, the effectiveness of both of these potentials in modeling collision frequencies eliminates the necessity of invoking a resonance enhancement to the collision cross section.",5
138,"The data in Fig. 3 also indicates that following the preparation of the short-lived rotational states within the ICl(,′ = 3) level, some of these excited-state molecules undergo collisions with He atoms in the expansion.",5

141,"It is also important to emphasize that the rotational structure indicates that bare ICl molecules are being promoted to rotational states within the ICl(,′ = 3) level, not He⋯ICl complexes that would form ICl(,′ = 2) products  vibrational predissociation of metastable He⋯ICl(,′ = 3) intermolecular vibrational levels.",3
142,"The rates and cross sections for the collision-induced, vibrational energy relaxation of ICl(,′ = 3) rotor states down to ICl(,′ = 2) states,  and , can be estimated using the  values measured at varying downstream distances.",6
143,"The fraction of the predissociative ICl(,′ = 3) excited-state molecules that re-stabilize in rotational states of the ICl(,′ = 2) level, , is estimated using the LIF spectra, Fig. 1, and published Franck–Condon factors; the ICl –, 3–0 Franck–Condon factors are three times greater than those of the 2–0 band.",6
144,"The integrated intensity of the 2–0 band is 30.4 on this intensity scale, and we would expect the 3–0 band to have an integrated intensity of 91.2 on the same scale if the ′ = 3 rotational states were not predissociative.",5
145,"Since the fluorescence following excitation of the 3–0 band is from the ICl(,′ = 2) level, we can directly compare the value of 91.2 to the integrated intensity of the 3–0 band, 0.12, and we find that  ≈ 1.3 × 10 at  = 11.2 and with a He-backing pressure of 14.8 bar.",5
146,"The rates, , can be approximated using the  values at each distance and the ICl(,′ = 3) excited-state lifetime.",6
147,"We assume that the contribution of the spontaneous emission of ICl(,′ = 3) is negligible.",6
148,"In order to calculate , we use  to determine the relative yields of the ICl(,′ = 2) and I P + Cl P products that result from collisional relaxation and non-adiabatic dissociation, respectively.",3
149,"We then assume a lifetime of 0.5 ns for non-adiabatic dissociation onto the ICl( 1) state, , corresponding to the lifetimes of ICl(,′ = 3) states with little rotational excitation.",6

153,"The values of  as well as , and  at each  are listed in Table 1.",5
154,"While several approximations and assumptions were made in extracting these cross sections, the large values are suggestive of the significant probability for vibrational relaxation of ICl(,′ = 3) rotor states induced by collisions with He atoms in the supersonic expansion.",4
155,"Our estimates of the vibrational relaxation cross sections of ICl(,′ = 3), 20–50 Å, are in accord with the reported cross sections for vibrational relaxation of I(,′) molecules in a He expansion, which are found to be in the range of 15 to 700 Å with a dependence on the initially prepared vibrational level, ′.",4
156,"The collision-induced vibrational relaxation of ICl* molecules should be proportional to the product of the He-atom carrier gas density and the ICl*–He collision frequency, as mentioned above.",7
157,"We have also monitored the dependence of the intensities of the ICl –, 2–0 and 3–0 LIF bands as a function of He-backing pressure; LIF spectra in each vibronic region were recorded at  = 10.7 nozzle diameters using various He-backing pressures between 11.4 and 28.6 bar.",9
158,"The values of  were found to change only slightly with increasing backing pressure throughout this pressure range, varying from 1.36(3) to 1.49(3) K. The ICl–He collision frequency, which should be approximately proportional to the ICl*–He collision frequency, was calculated using eqns (1), (3), and (4) and assuming  is equal to either  or  at each pressure.",5
159,"The collision frequency increased linearly with backing pressure, as expected.",5
160,"The intensity of the ICl –, 3–0 band also increases with He-backing pressure and tracks roughly with the collision frequency of ICl molecules with He atoms in the expansion.",4
161,"This similar dependence on the backing pressures supports the conclusion that the ICl(,′ = 2) molecules that are detected following preparation of ICl(,′ = 3) rotor states are a consequence of collision-induced vibrational relaxation.",4
162,"Having observed that the ICl –, 3–0 band is detected as a result of collision-induced vibrational relaxation with He atoms in the expansion, we sought to characterize the full-collision dynamical process by examining the ICl(,′ = 2,′) rotational product-state distribution.",0
163,"This distribution could then be compared to the recently published He⋯ICl half-collision data in an effort to understand the relationships, if any, between the two processes.",0
164,"In order to do this, high-resolution pump–probe spectra were recorded by probing the Δ = −1 channel that results from collisions between molecules initially prepared in the long-lived ICl(,′ = 2) and short-lived ICl(,′ = 3) levels and He atoms in the expansion.",3
165,"The spectra were taken using a He-backing pressure of 14.8 bar, and at a downstream distance of  = 11.2.",10
166,"Under these conditions an ICl(,″ = 0) rotational temperature of . 1.5 K was measured.",8
167,"The rotationally resolved spectrum of the ICl –, 10–2 band recorded with the pump laser fixed on the ICl –, 3–0 bandhead, which corresponds to excitation of the ′ = 1–3 rotor levels, is shown in Fig. 4a.",8
168,"The spectrum of the ICl –, 9–1 band recorded with the pump laser fixed on the ICl –, 2–0 bandhead, which also corresponds to excitation of the ′ = 1–3 rotor levels, is plotted in Fig. 4b for comparison.",8
169,"The rotational quantum number of the ICl(,′) state associated with several of the -lines are shown to emphasize the degree of rotational excitation in the product channels.",8
170,Note that the -rotor lines are overlapped by weaker -lines originating from states with higher rotational excitation.,8
171,"The highest observed rotor lines are the (21) and the (23) lines in the 10–2 and 9–1 spectra, respectively.",8
172,"We believe that these spectra are of the nascent product-state distributions since pump–probe spectra were recorded at two extreme distances downstream, 5 mm and 20 mm, and therefore in regions with different collision frequencies, and no significant changes in the rotational distributions were observed.",4
173,"The rotational-state distributions of the Δ = −1 vibrational relaxation channels were determined using a linear least-squares fitting algorithm, known spectroscopic constants, and the appropriate rotational linestrength factors to fit the rotational contours.",3
174,"The distributions obtained from the ICl –, 10–2 and 9–1 bands, Fig. 4a and b, are plotted as a function of ICl(,′) internal rotational energy in Fig. 5a as black circles and open squares, respectively.",8
175,The rotational-state distributions are bimodal with an overall maximum at ′ = 6 and another maximum at ′ = 12 in both of the Δ = −1 channels.,8
176,"Minima were observed at ′ = 8 and 10 for the ICl(,′ = 2) and ICl(,′ = 1) products, respectively.",8
177,The mean rotational energy found in each of these product levels is 9.5 and 10.9 cm.,5
178,"Since the energy difference between the ICl(,′ = 3,′ = 0) and ICl(,′ = 2,′ = 0) states and the ICl(,′ = 2,′ = 0) and ICl(,′ = 1,′ = 0) states is 163.4 and 182.7 cm, respectively, we can estimate the fraction of the available energy that is found in rotational excitation of the products.",6
179,"The amount of energy found in the ICl(,′ = 2) and ICl(,′ = 1), Δ = −1 vibrational relaxation channels represents . 6% of the total available energy.",4
180,"Thus, most of the available energy is converted into kinetic energy of the ICl* and He collision partners.",4
181,"We have recorded LIF spectra of ICl entrained in a number of different carrier gases to qualitatively check for the effect of the collision partner on the vibrational relaxation of ICl(,′ = 3).",9
182,"Recall that the intensity of the ICl –, 3–0 band is . 10 times weaker than the 2–0 band when using a He-carrier gas with a backing pressure of 14.8 bar and at  = 10.7.",8
183,"In contrast, the intensity of the 3–0 band is significantly smaller, . 10 times weaker, than the 2–0 when using a 90% Ne in He carrier gas at the same backing pressure and distance.",8
184,"When using a 100% Ar carrier gas, no ICl –, 3–0 LIF signals were observed.",8
185,"It should be noted, though, that the intensity of the ICl –, 2–0 LIF feature is weaker when using an Ar-carrier gas and, consequently, the signal-to-noise levels are worse than those of the ICl in He or Ne/He spectra.",8
186,"Finally, LIF spectra were also recorded using a pure hydrogen expansion.",9
187,"The intensities of the ICl –, 3–0 features in these ICl/H spectra are about twice those measured in the helium expansion.",8
188,"The different efficiencies for vibrational relaxation with the He, Ne, Ar, and H collision partners do not appear to be a result of the corresponding attractive intermolecular potential wells in the excited state.",4
189,"The intermolecular potential energy surfaces for He + ICl(,′ = 3), Ne + ICl(,′ = 3), and -H + ICl(,′ = 3) have all been shown to have minima in the T-shaped orientation with binding energies of 16.2(7), 65(5), and 69.5(3)–76.3(3) cm, respectively.",1
190,"Of these three collision partners, Ne is observed to have the smallest probability for inducing vibrational relaxation even though the excited-state binding energy of ICl(,′ = 3) with Ne is significantly larger than that with He and comparable to that with H.",5
191,"The lighter H partner, in contrast, is the most efficient vibrational relaxation partner.",5
192,"This might lead one to believe that it is the mass mismatch, and thus the velocity slip, between the ICl molecule and the collision partner that gives rise to the different probabilities for collisional relaxation.",4
193,"However, using the aforementioned binding energies of the He⋯ICl, Ne⋯ICl, and H⋯ICl complexes to estimate their well depth, as well as our velocity-slip experiments to determine , we find that the velocity slip is not nearly large enough to account for the different values of  that would be required to justify the observed vibrational-relaxation efficiencies.",4
194,"For instance, in order to be in accord with our observed efficiencies, the  for the Ne expansion would have to be three orders of magnitude less than  for the He expansion.",4
195,"Using our observed upper limit for the slip temperature for the He calculations and assuming no slip for the Ne calculations, the worst case scenario, we find that there is a factor of 2.5 more collisions in the Ne expansion than in the He expansion.",5
196,This indicates that some other phenomenon must be giving rise to the observed trends.,4
197,"Thus, we propose an alternative possibility.",1
198,"In our group’s work on the Ne⋯ICl complex, we noted that the signals observed in the ICl –, 2–0 region were larger than the signals observed in the 3–0 region.",1
199,This was attributed to the competition between electronic predissociation and vibrational predissociation that is present in the 3–0 region due to the presence of the nearby repulsive ICl( 1) electronic state.,1
200,"Because of the strong possibility that Ne⋯ICl(,′ = 3) van der Waals complexes undergo electronic predissociation, we find it plausible that collisions between Ne atoms and ICl(,′ = 3) excited-state molecules can induce non-adiabatic dissociation of ICl  the repulsive 1 state.",4
201,This mechanism would compete with vibrational relaxation and thereby reduce the observed yields for the collisional-relaxation products.,4
202,"Furthermore, because of the relatively large mass and polarizability of Ne compared to H or He, collision-induced non-adiabatic dissociation should be much more prevalent with a Ne carrier gas than with H or He.",4
203,"It is interesting to compare the results of the full-collision dynamics with those of the recently reported half-collision, vibrational predissociation dynamics of He⋯ICl(,′ = 3) van der Waals complexes prepared with varying amounts of intermolecular vibrational excitation.",9
204,"Collision-induced vibrational relaxation results in a bimodal ICl(,′ − 1) rotational state distribution with maxima at ′ = 6 and 12 and a minimum at ′ = 8 or 10, Fig. 5a.",8
205,"Bimodal distributions are also evident in the vibrational predissociation measurements of He⋯ICl(,′ = 3) when preparing the complex in the lowest, ′ = 0, and second excited, ′ = 2, intermolecular vibrational levels.",8
206,"When more highly excited intermolecular vibrational levels are prepared, however, the bimodal structure blurs out.",8
207,"The ICl(,′ = 2) rotational product-state distributions that result from vibrational predissociation for these two extreme cases was reported previously, Fig. 5 of , and is plotted here in Fig. 5b.",1
208,"The ICl(,′ = 2) rotational populations that result following the preparation of complexes in the metastable He⋯ICl(,′ = 3,′ = 0,′ = 0) and He⋯ICl(,′ = 3, ′ = 4, ′ = 1) states are shown as black diamonds and open triangles, respectively.",1
209,"While both of these vibrational predissociation product-state distributions bear some resemblance to those of the collision-induced product-state distribution, Fig. 5a, the distribution formed from the vibrational predissociation of the ′ = 0, ′ = 0 level is quantitatively more similar.",8
210,"Qualitatively, the bimodal structure for this channel is reproduced almost identically, with maxima at ′ = 5 and 13 and a minimum at ′ = 10.",8
211,"The main difference is that in the collisional-relaxation data the two maxima have comparable populations, while vibrational predissociation from the ′ = 0, ′ = 0 level has the first maxima with significantly more population.",8
212,"Vibrational predissociation from the ′ = 4,′ = 1 level is better in this respect, but lacks a definitive bimodal distribution as well as non-negligible population at  > 20 cm.",8
213,"Quantitatively, a comparison of the residuals between the collisional-relaxation product-state distribution and the half-collision ′ = 0, ′ = 0 distribution is . 35% less than for the comparison with the ′ = 4, ′ = 1 distribution.",5
214,"Somewhat surprisingly, then, collision-induced vibrational relaxation mimics vibrational predissociation from lower intermolecular vibrational levels that tend to more localized in the T-shaped region, ′ = 0 or 2, more closely than vibrational predissociation from more highly excited intermolecular vibrational levels with states that are delocalized in the angular coordinate, such as the ′ = 4 level.",5
215,"A possible explanation for this behavior may be that in colliding with the ICl molecule at the low temperatures achieved in the expansion, the He atom is steered by the He + ICl(,′ = 3) potential where it tends to find the region of the minimum of the multi-dimensional PES, which is also where the lowest bound intermolecular vibrational level is localized.",4
216,"Hence, similar rotational product-state distributions are observed.",4
217,"Pathways that compete with the non-adiabatic dissociation of electronically excited ICl(,′ = 3) in a He-carrier gas expansion are investigated using LIF and two-laser, pump–probe spectroscopy.",9
218,We find that collisions between ICl molecules and He atoms occur over extended distances along the expansion direction.,5
219,"The collision frequency between molecules prepared in the short-lived ICl(,′ = 3) level and the He atoms is high enough that vibrational relaxation down to rotational states in the next lower ICl(,′ = 2) level can occur with measurable yields.",5
220,"At the same time, the vibrational relaxation can be modeled using a Lennard-Jones 6–12 collision-frequency model, arguing that there is no need to invoke a resonance-enhancement to the collisional cross section.",4
221,"The rotational-state distributions of the low-energy, collision-induced vibrational relaxation and of the vibrational predissociation from low-lying He⋯ICl(,′) intermolecular vibrational levels are seen to match quite well as opposed to the agreement with the distributions from the vibrational predissociation of levels that have more intermolecular vibrational excitation and are delocalized in the angular coordinate.",4
222,"This suggests that at low temperatures, the He atoms are steered toward the minimum of the He + ICl(,′ = 3) intermolecular potential before scattering off the repulsive wall.",4
223,The ability to accurately measure the ICl vibrational and rotational product-state distributions suggests that this system would be well-suited for complimentary theoretical investigations of intermolecular energy transfer.,4

138,Distamycin addition is found to inhibit the cleavage activity of the ternary complexes suggesting minor groove directing nature of – similarly to BLMs.,4
139,A similar inhibition of DNA cleavage is observed in the presence of hydroxyl radical scavengers such as DMSO indicating an oxidative cleavage pathway involving hydroxyl radicals.,4
140,"Although the true identity of the reactive oxygen species is yet to be conclusively established, it could be either free hydroxyl radical or a metal bound oxo or hydroxo moiety effecting hydrogen abstraction from the deoxyribose sugar moiety.",4
141,The oxidative nature of the DNA cleavage is evidenced from the T4 ligase experiments which show no religation of the nicked circular DNA to its original SC form thus excluding the possibility of any hydrolytic cleavage.,5
142,The disulfide bond of the Schiff base R′SSR is found to be stable under reducing conditions in the presence of excess MPA as the control experiments show enhancement of DNA cleavage efficiency of the ternary complex on increasing the concentration of MPA.,5
143,"In conclusion, the ternary kanamycin A complex, obtained from a dicopper(ii) precursor containing a pendant cationic amine moiety, exemplifies the first potential model for three functional domains of BLMs.",4
144,"While the precursor complex is cleavage inactive, the ternary complexes containing kanamycin A and phen show efficient oxidative DNA cleavage in the presence of MPA.",5

146,The higher cleavage efficiency of the phen complex in comparison to – could be related to the efficient DNA groove binding ability of this planar heterocyclic base.,4
0,The low energy tautomers and conformers of the dipeptides HisGly and GlyHis and of their sodium ion complexes in the gas phase,9

2,"For each dipeptide, both the N–H and N–H tautomers of the imidazole side chain of His were considered.",3
3,"For each of the four isomeric dipeptides, 20–30 conformers were fully characterized at the  level.",3
4,"All low energy structures are found to involve H-bonding at the N position of imidazole, either as a N–H donor or a N acceptor, depending upon the tautomer.",5
5,"In three out of the four species, the most stable conformer involves a C-terminus carboxylic acid in its less favorable  conformation, in order to maximize intramolecular H bonding.",5
6,"It turns out that the lowest energy tautomer of HisGly is N–H, while that of GlyHis is N–H.",5
7,This result argues in favor of the diversity of His tautomeric states in peptides and proteins.,4
8,"The sodium cation complexes of both GlyHis and HisGly have been studied as well, again considering both tautomers in each case.",9
9,"In three out of the four species, the most stable structure involves chelation of sodium by the two carbonyl oxygens and the imidazole ring.",5
10,"On the contrary, the sodium complex of the N–H tautomer of HisGly favors chelation to the peptidic carbonyl oxygen, the imidazole ring and the amino terminus.",5
11,"In the N–H tautomers of both peptides, the most favorable binding site of imidazole is the N nitrogen, while in the N–H tautomers, it is the π cloud which provides side chain interaction.",5
12,"As a result, both GlyHisNa and HisGlyNa favor the N–H tautomer of His, in contrast to what was found for the free peptides.",4
13,"Among all naturally occurring α-amino acids in living systems, histidine (His) occupies a special position.",1
14,"The side chain of His, methylene-imidazole, bears two nitrogen atoms with variable protonation states.",1
15,"Their p’s are such that imidazole may easily exchange protons with its surroundings in the biologically significant range of pH, effectively supporting many chemical reactions.",1
16,"Because of this versatility, histidine has been found to be involved in . 50% of the active sites of all enzymes, in a recent analysis of the enzyme structural database.",1
17,The Lewis basicity of His also makes it a common ligand in the first metal coordination sphere of metallo-proteins.,1
18,"It is even considered that coordinated His may exist in its fully deprotonated form, at least as a transient species.",1
19,"Therefore, the protonation state of His in peptides and proteins is a matter of great interest.",2
20,"In the pH range 6.3–9.0 in aqueous solution at room temperature, isolated His exists as a zwitterion with a non-protonated side chain imidazole.",1
21,"In this and higher pH range, the imidazole is in either of two tautomeric forms, N–H and N–H.",1
22,Scheme 1 shows the two N–H and N–H tautomers in the non-zwitterionic form.,1
23,"Protonation of either form at the imino nitrogen leads to an imidazolium ion from which proton release may occur from either of the two nitrogens, leading to each of the two tautomers.",1
24,"In His-containing peptides and proteins, it is therefore expected that the occurrence of the two tautomers is strongly influenced by the presence of H bond donors and acceptors in the surroundings, and by the chemical reactions which occur.",1
25,Determining the tautomer populations in proteins usually relies on NMR measurements.,3
26,"One-dimensional measurements on various nuclei suffer from various drawbacks, although N spectra have been shown to yield unambiguous information on His tautomers in N-enriched proteins, and in isolated His at various pH and temperatures, in several solvents.",3
27,"More recently, several techniques have been devised to identify the protonation state and tautomeric forms of His, including N–C  couplings and 2D H/C correlations.",3
28,"It remains the case, however, that the protonation and tautomeric states of most His residues in most crystallographic structures in protein databases are not unequivocally assigned.",1
29,"In such cases, hydrogen locations are assigned, either in the structure determination and refinement procedure, or in post-structural analysis, using tools whose reliability is not known in general.",3
30,"A recent computational and statistical study has indeed issued a warning signal about the significance of proton positions in His residues in protein databases, whenever specific NMR data is not available.",3
31,"This study, based on local energy minimization of His side chain torsions using the Amber force field, showed that proton assignments appear to be no better than random.",1
32,"Thus it is currently difficult to extract from structural databases whether there is a strong preference for one of the tautomers of His in proteins, even with the restriction to the interior of proteins, where the solvent is not expected to have a strong influence.",1
33,One result of the computational study is that there appears to be no general preference for one tautomer over the other.,1
34,"In order to understand in details the factors determining the relative stabilities of His tautomers, it is therefore of interest to study model systems.",2
35,"The situation is simple in isolated His, for which N NMR, as well as other techniques, have established that the N–H tautomer is largely dominant.",1
36,"This dominance has been discussed in terms of the intramolecular hydrogen bond which may establish between the N and one or two of the N–H bond(s) of the ammonium group (note that in the following, we use the notation N and N, with δ and ε as subscripts, for the imidazole nitrogen atom at the δ and ε position, respectively, so that N–H and N–H denote the nitrogen–hydrogen bonds at these positions.",1
37,"On the other hand, N–H and N–H, with δ and ε as superscripts, are used to describe the tautomers with the N–H bond at the δ and ε position, respectively).",1
38,"The same type of argument was found to explain the structure of the dipeptide HisGly, for which several crystal structures have been determined.",1
39,"In the crystals of both the chloride and dichloride salts of HisGly (with one and two chloride ions, and singly and doubly protonated HisGly, respectively), there appears to be a strong hydrogen bond between the ammonium group and the imine N of imidazole.",1
40,"The crystal structure of the hemihydrate of HisGly has also been obtained, in which the His side chain is not protonated; the structural parameters are consistent with the existence of a zwitterion, involving a N-terminus ammonium and a C-terminus carboxylate.",1
41,"Rather surprisingly, it was found that the crystal structure contains two peptide molecules per asymmetric crystal unit, in the two different tautomeric forms.",1
42,"One is the expected N–H tautomer while the second is the N–H tautomer, involving H-bonding between N–H and the C terminal carboxylate.",1
43,Thus it appears that HisGly is a simple model in which the coexistence and possible competition between the two tautomers of His already exist.,1
44,"For this reason, we have explored the conformational landscape of HisGly.",9
45,"In order to delineate in detail the interactions which influence the relative stabilities of the tautomers, we have also studied its dipeptide isomer GlyHis, for which there is no structural information available, to the best of our knowledge.",0
46,Clearly such simple models lack the side chain–side chain interactions in which His imidazoles are often involved in proteins.,3
47,Yet local interactions within small dipeptides are found to have a significant influence on the relative stabilities of the tautomers.,3
48,"We have also studied the sodium cation complexes of HisGly and GlyHis, since in a recent study of the Na complexes of a series of small peptides, we found that there exists a significant sequence effect on the binding affinities of HisGly and GlyHis to Na.",9
49,"Sodium is known to bind peptides mostly through their oxygen atoms, however, in GlyHis and HisGly, it is expected that the imidazole side chain can provide an additional binding site, in a way which will depend significantly upon the tautomer.",1
50,"In the present context, it is interesting to see if cation attachment may be a way to differentiate tautomers.",2
51,"The detailed understanding of the conformation landscape of small biomolecules is a challenging task, both because there is generally a large to very large number of low-lying energy minima, and because energy barriers connecting these minima are often small, leading to several conformers being populated at room temperature.",1
52,"Various experimental methods are capable of yielding some structural data on such molecules, yet it remains very difficult to identify the lowest energy conformers with certainty, and to obtain an overview of the potential energy surface.",3
53,"Quantum chemistry is an efficient alternative to experimental methods to explore the conformations of flexible molecules of relatively small size, as it provides relative energies of conformers with good accuracy, and enables a thorough exploration of the potential energy surface.",3
54,"There has been ample work on the conformations of Gly in the 1990’s, and other amino acids have also been studied, including alanine, serine, cysteine, valine, proline, glutamic acid and arginine.",1
55,Several oligopeptides have also been studied.,1
56,Herein we use  computations to establish the structures of the low energy conformations of the dipeptides GlyHis and HisGly in each of their possible tautomeric forms.,0
57,Analogous work has also been carried out for the sodium cation complexes of the four isomers.,0
58,The number of weakly hindered rotors (seven covalent single bonds between non-hydrogen atoms) is large enough in GlyHis and HisGly that constructing structures based on chemical intuition solely is not appropriate.,3
59,"Thus we resorted to a non local exploration of the potential energy surface, as a preliminary step prior to local geometry optimization with the  methods mentioned below.",3
60,"Monte Carlo sampling was carried out with the Metropolis criterion at 300 K, in which random values were generated for the torsion angles around all single bonds between non-hydrogen atoms except the peptide bond.",10
61,"In order to keep this procedure computationally tractable, the Amber 94 force field was used for energy calculations, with RESP atomic charges.",10
62,At least two independent searches were performed for each case.,10
63,A limit of 1000 random tries or 500 geometry optimizations was set for each search.,10
64,"The first search was started from a β-strand like extended structure, while the second was started from the lowest energy structure found in the first, ensuring that the two would be largely different.",10
65,Random sampling was systematically followed by local geometry optimization at the same level.,10
66,However the Amber calculations lead to an energy ordering of conformers which deviates significantly from that obtained with accurate  calculations.,8
67,"In order to locate all of the low lying structures, a large sample was selected from the Amber results and subjected to geometry re-optimization at the  level, typically between 20 and 30 in each case (each tautomeric form of GlyHis and HisGly).",0
68,"In one case, the N–H tautomer of HisGly, we first searched the potential energy surface without a Monte Carlo search, but rather with a combination of scanning the relevant torsion angles and selecting structures on the basis of maximizing hydrogen bond interaction.",10
69,Then we carried out an MC search starting from one of the low energy structures previously found.,10
70,"This led structures of ranks 5, 10 and 1 at the optimized Amber level to insert into those previously obtained, and become structures of ranks 2, 6 and 18, respectively, after  re-optimization and final energy calculations.",8
71,"Yet this procedure is too lengthy to be used in general, therefore we resorted to initial MC searches for all three other cases.",3
72,"In all cases, the lowest 15 structures at the  level arose from structures in the lower half of the Amber set, which contained from 30 to 40 unique structures, depending upon the case.",8
73,"The experience gained from the N–H tautomer of HisGly led us to inspect all of the low energy structures finally obtained at the  level, and change some torsions when it appeared that a related structure might be of lower energy based on the criterion of enhancement of the hydrogen bond network.",3
74,"We believe it is this combination of random and hydrogen bonding searches that may lead to an efficient determination of most, if not all, of the low energy conformers.",4
75,Yet the present work does not aim at providing an exhaustive description of these very complex potential energy surfaces.,4
76,calculations were carried out at levels which represent a compromise between accuracy and tractability for consideration of a significant number of structures.,3
77,"Geometries were optimized at the HF/6-31G(d) level, vibrational analyses were carried out at the same level to determine zero-point vibrational energies, thermal corrections to total energies, and entropies.",10
78,"Final energetics were determined at the MP2(full)/6-311+G(2d,2p) level using the HF/6-31G(d) geometries, a level of computation which has been previously shown to yield accurate energetics.",10
79,"All results mentioned below are computed at this MP2(full)/6-311+G(2d,2p)//HF/6-31G(d) level except otherwise noted.",10
80,"Relative energies computed at the HF and MP2 levels were usually found to be in satisfactory agreement with each other (differing by less than 10 kJ mol, and often by less than 5 kJ mol).",5
81,"It turned out, however, that in some cases the differences were as large as 10–25 kJ mol.",8
82,A careful inspection showed that such large differences occur when the conformers being compared have the C-terminal carboxylic acid in different conformations (. ).,5
83,"Test calculations on acetic acid itself indicate that the - relative energy is 7 kJ mol lower at the MP2(full)/6-311+G(2d,2p)//HF/6-31G(d) level, compared to the HF/6-31G(d) result.",8
84,"Moreover, low energy structures always bear a  carboxylic acid that is H-bond donating, and this H bond is not very accurately described at the HF level.",5
85,"Since the energy differences between the best structures of the two tautomers turned out to be very small for both dipeptides, additional calculations were carried out.",5
86,"The geometries of the most stable conformers were optimized at the MP2/6-31G(d) level, and final energetics were recomputed at the MP2/6-311+G(2d,2p)//MP2/6-31G(d) and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ(−f)//MP2/6-31G(d) levels.",10
87,"In the latter “(−f)” indicates that the most diffuse f functions on C, N and O, and the most diffuse d functions on H have been dropped from the regular aug-cc-pVTZ set As described in the text, these more accurate levels lead to relative energies in reasonable agreement with the MP2(full)/6-311+G(2d,2p)//HF/6-31G(d) values.",6
88,"In particular, there was no change on the energetic ordering.",8
89,"Monte Carlo calculations were carried out with HyperChem 6.0, while the Gaussian03 package was used for  calculations.",10
90,"Several different ways are conceivable for the description of conformers, for each of the tautomers of HisGly and GlyHis.",6
91,"This is due to the presence of seven weakly hindered rotors in each species: the C–C(O) and C–N of the main chain of each residue, the C–C and C–C of the His side chain, and the C–OH bond of the C-terminus acid.",6
92,"Describing each of the conformers by the value of the torsion angle around each of these bonds would be rather tedious, although it would carry all of the information.",6
93,"We have chosen to define families using a hierarchy of structural criteria (descriptors), of which several are non local.",6
94,The first descriptor is the existence of a hydrogen bond between an atom of the main chain and the N or N–H of the imidazole ring.,6
95,"All of the low energy conformers determined in this work bear such a hydrogen bond; for instance for the N–H tautomer of GlyHis, the lowest lying conformer found without a hydrogen bond at N is higher in energy than the most stable by 18 kJ mol.",6
96,"We denote the cyclic motif formed by such H bonds as “C”, meaning that the H bond generates a -membered cycle.",6
97,"The various types of C structures, C–C, are depicted schematically in Scheme 2.",6
98,The arrows in Scheme 2 are oriented from the hydrogen bond donor to the acceptor.,6
99,"For instance in the N–H tautomers of HisGly and GlyHis, the N–H bond can be a H-donor towards the carbonyl oxygen of His, generating a C motif.",6
100,"C motifs also exist for the N–H tautomers, in which the N atom is a H-bond acceptor from an N–H bond of Gly in HisGly or the C-terminus OH bond in GlyHis.",6
101,"On the other hand, in none of the conformers is the N or N–H oriented in such a way as to engage in a H bond of any C type, because the dipeptide chain is too short.",6
102,The second conformation descriptor is the conformation of the C ring.,6
103,The types of ring conformations encountered in low energy structures are presented in more detail in Fig. 1.,6
104,"C rings connect the N position to the main chain nitrogen of His, which is the peptidic nitrogen in GlyHis and the N terminus in HisGly.",6
105,"In both N–H tautomers, there are two possible conformations, chair and half-chair (see Fig. 1).",6
106,"Note that the half-chair may be inverted, leading to a different energy since steric repulsions with the rest of the molecule are different.",6
107,"In the N–H tautomer of HisGly, a chair conformation is formed by H bonding from the N–H to the amino terminus.",6
108,"For GlyHis, the H bond would point to the peptidic nitrogen, but the rigidity of the peptide linkage precludes formation of the C ring in this case.",6
109,"Other C rings may be formed in several isomers, but the C is the only one which occurs in all.",6
110,The various C possibilities have been introduced above.,6
111,"We find two conformations for the C, half-chair-like and boat-like.",6
112,"Hydrogen bonding is favored when the N–H⋯OC segment is nearly planar in both types of conformation, since it allows the N–H bond to point approximately towards an oxygen lone pair, and the two bond dipoles to be oriented favourably for electrostatic stabilization.",6
113,This restricts significantly the flexibility of the C motif.,6
114,"As shown in Fig. 1, formation of a C ring is possible only for the N–H tautomer of GlyHis, connecting the N–H bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly.",6
115,We found two conformations for this C which may be loosely defined as half-chair-like and boat-like.,6
116,"As for C, a C ring is compatible with one isomer only; in this case it is the N–H tautomer of GlyHis, in which the H bond connects N to one of the N–H bonds of the amino terminus.",6
117,"The C ring is associated in some cases with a C ring, when the main chain is oriented in a way which also permits interaction of N with the peptidic N–H bond.",6
118,"Finally, C rings exist in both tautomers of HisGly.",6
119,"In the N–H tautomer it is due to a H bond between the N–H bond and the oxygens at the C terminus, while in the N–H tautomer, the H bond is between the C terminus O–H bond of the  conformation of carboxylic acid and N.",6
120,"In both cases, we find two conformers, which are deduced from each other by a 180° rotation around the C–N bond of Gly (see Fig. 1).",6
121,This leads to opposite orientations of the OC−N–H peptidic group with respect to the mean plane of the C cycle.,6
122,The third descriptor is the relative orientations of the peptidic OC–N–H plane with respect to that of the C terminal carboxylic acid.,6
123,"There are two rough relative orientations: either coplanar, defining a fragment of a β sheet, or perpendicular.",6
124,"Finally, the fourth descriptor is the relative position of imidazole and of the peptidic plane.",6
125,"“Open” conformers correspond to extended structures, in which the Gly residue and imidazole are distant,  they cannot interact  H bonding.",6
126,"“Closed” conformers are such that such H bonds can be established, between the N position of His and an atom of either the peptidic bond or of the C terminus.",6
127,"Altogether, each existing combination of these four descriptors defines a “family”.",6
128,"We have noted these families with capital roman numbers, in the stability order.",6
129,"For instance for the N–H tautomer of GlyHis, the lowest energy conformer belongs to family “I”, which corresponds to the existence of a C ring, in a boat-like conformation, in a “closed” relative orientation of Gly and imidazole, and a perpendicular relative orientation of the peptidic and carboxylic planes.",6
130,"Within each family, there remain conformational differences.",6
131,These are specified by the orientation of the terminal NH and COOH groups.,6
132,"The various possibilities encountered in low energy structures are gathered in Fig. 2, together with the numbering used hereafter.",6
133,"For instance in conformations “1” the NH terminus is a H bond acceptor towards the peptidic N–H, while in “2” it is a H bond donor towards the peptidic oxygen, .",6
134,"In conformations “a” the carboxylic C terminus is in its  conformation and it is a H bond donor towards the peptidic oxygen, while in “b” it is , and a H bond acceptor from the peptidic N–H.",6
135,"There is some redundancy between these notations and the specification of the C rings, since, , conformations 5 are C rings (see Fig. 2).",6
136,"For all isomers, the most stable conformer of each family is depicted in Fig. 3–6.",6
137,"In order to illustrate the conformational flexibility offered by the NH and COOH termini, the six most stable conformations of the most stable family of the N–H tautomer of GlyHis are shown in Fig. 7.",6
138,"The relative energies of all conformers, grouped in five families according to the descriptors defined above, are gathered in the left part of Table 1.",8
139,"The structures of the most stable conformers for each of the first five families are shown in Fig. 3, while a series of conformers of family I are shown in Fig. 7.",8
140,"The best structure overall is I-1-ad, which bears a C ring with a H bond from the N–H to the His carbonyl oxygen.",5
141,"In order to maximize H bonding, the carboxyl group is , enabling H bond donation from its O–H bond to the peptidic oxygen (which happens to be a C ring of another type, not used herein for structure specification).",4
142,The so-defined orientation of the peptide linkage is such that its N–H bond may interact with the π cloud of imidazole.,4
143,"At the same time, the NH terminus is oriented in such a way as to be a H bond acceptor from the peptidic N–H.",5
144,"This structure is particularly stable since all heteroatoms are engaged in H bonding, except for the N (for which it is structurally impossible).",4
145,"The second most stable conformer is I-2-ad (see Fig. 7), 10 kJ mol less stable than I-1-ad.",5
146,The only difference between I-1-ad and I-2-ad is the orientation of the CHNH at the N-terminus.,8
147,"In I-1-ad, the amino terminus is a H bond acceptor from the peptidic N–H, while in I-2-ad it is a double H bond donor to the peptidic oxygen.",5
148,"In all cases studied herein, we find the same energy ordering between these two orientations of the N terminus.",5
149,"The next conformer of the same family (the fourth most stable overall) is I-3-ad, which differs from I-2-ad by the orientation of the amino terminus, which interacts with the peptidic oxygen  a single N–H bond rather than both.",5
150,"The fact that this single N–H bond is better oriented towards the peptidic oxygen than either of the N–H bonds in I-2-ad does not compensate completely for the loss of one interaction, leading to a destabilization of 3 kJ mol ( 13 kJ mol less stable than I-1-ad).",4
151,Other conformers of the same family have the carboxyl group in the  conformation.,8
152,"Although it is intrinsically more stable than the  (by 22 kJ mol in acetic acid), it does not allow simultaneous H bonding to the oxygen carbonyl on the one hand, and from the O–H bond on the other.",5
153,"The most stable of such conformers is I-1-d, which differs from I-1-ad only by the orientation of the OH group.",5
154,It lies 17 kJ mol higher in energy.,8
155,"Other conformers add to this another less favourable interaction relative to I-1-ad, such as the orientation of the amino terminus, or the hydroxyl oxygen instead of the more basic carbonyl oxygen as a H bond acceptor (see Fig. 7), and are more than 20 kJ mol less stable than I-1-ad.",5
156,We now turn to the lowest energy conformers of other families.,9
157,"The most stable structure in family II, II-1-b, shown in Fig. 3, bears a C ring.",5
158,"Here it is the peptide carbonyl oxygen, rather than that of the carboxyl terminus, which interacts with the N–H bond of imidazole.",5
159,The peptide linkage is oriented in such a way as to allow H bond donation from the peptidic N–H to both the amino terminus and the carbonyl oxygen of the C terminus.,5
160,It is 12 kJ mol less stable than I-1-ad.,8
161,"The most stable structure in family III, III-1-b, has a C ring analogous to that in family II, however, in a boat-like conformation.",5
162,"The peptide linkage has the same orientation as II-1-b, and thus forms the same H bonds involving the amidic hydrogen.",5
163,"The most stable structure in family IV, IV-1-bd, has a C ring involving the C-terminus carbonyl oxygen as in family I, however, the ring has a half-chair-like conformation, while it is boat-like in family I. The two families also differ by the relative orientations of the peptidic and C-terminus planes (third descriptor above), perpendicular for family I and parallel for family IV.",5
164,"This parallel orientation is common with family II, and it allows again the peptidic N–H bond to interact with both termini.",5
165,"This leaves the peptidic carbonyl oxygen without a H bond, so that this structure is less stable than I-1-ad by 14 kJ mol.",5
166,"Family V has a C ring of the same type as that of family I, but they differ by their conformation: half-chair-like in I, and boat-like in V. With a cis carboxyl group leaving the OH bond without H bonding, the most structure of family V, V-1-d, lies 16 kJ mol above I-1-a.",5
167,"Some additional, generally less stable, conformers of this species may be found in Table 1.",8
168,The relative energies of all conformers are gathered in the right part of Table 1.,8
169,The most stable conformers for each of the first seven families are shown in Fig. 4.,8
170,"As for the most stable conformer of the N–H tautomer, the most stable structure (I-1-jb) involves a boat-like C ring, which is closed in this case by a O–H⋯N bond from the C terminus to the imidazole N.",5
171,"For this to occur, the carboxyl group is in its  conformation, another feature that is common to both tautomers.",5
172,"The main chain has parallel peptide and carboxyl groups, and has glycine and imidazole in an open arrangement.",5
173,This allows the peptidic N–H to interact with both the C-terminus carbonyl oxygen and with the amino terminus.,5
174,"On the other hand, the open structure precludes any interaction of the peptide carbonyl, which may explain why this conformer is less stable than the best N–H conformer (see Table 1; at the MP2/6-311+G(2d,2p)//MP2/6-31G* level, this difference is 6.5 kJ mol).",4
175,"The second most stable conformer (I-2-jb, not shown) resembles the first, the only difference being that the amino terminus is a H bond donor towards the peptidic carbonyl, rather than an acceptor from the peptidic N–H.",5
176,Thus the lower portion of the conformational spaces of the N–H and N–H tautomers are fairly similar.,8
177,"The third most stable structure is also the first of family II (II-1,5-b, see Fig. 4).",8
178,"It has a C ring connecting the amino terminus to the imidazole N, and in addition, the relative orientations of the peptide linkage and of the carboxyl group, and of the main chain and the imidazole, enable the formation of a C ring between N and the peptidic N–H.",5
179,"This structure is 7 kJ mol higher in energy than I-1,5-jb.",8
180,"A structure analogous to that of II-1,5-b, with a C ring and planar main chain, is found with IV-1,5-b (the seventh most stable conformer in Table 2).",8
181,"However the C conformation is different, precluding the formation of a C ring.",5
182,"This conformer is only 3 kJ mol less stable than II-1,5-b.",8
183,"It is likely that the loss of a H bond is partly compensated by a smaller strain, permitting better relative orientations of the amino terminus and the peptidic N–H for H bonding.",4
184,"A slightly more stable structure is the best conformer of family III, III-1-f.",8
185,Its favourable features are a C ring and a H bond from the peptidic N–H to the amino terminus.,5
186,"However, none of its carboxyl oxygens can engage into H bonds, which is why this structure is 8 kJ mol higher in energy than I-1-jb.",5
187,"Another structure shown in Fig. 4 is V-1-b, which has a stable, planar main chain skeleton, but which lacks a H bond to the imidazole N.",8
188,"This leads to a high energy, 18 kJ mol higher above I-1-jb.",8
189,"Other structures in Fig. 4, the most stable of families VI and VII, are of even higher energies.",8
190,"There are also conformers of intermediate energies, in the 12–20 kJ mol range above I-1-jb, which are not described in detail here, but for which the specification of descriptors in Table 2 should be reasonably explicit.",8
191,The relative energies of all conformers found are gathered in the left part of Table 2.,8
192,The structures of the most stable conformers for each of the eight families identified are shown in Fig. 5.,8
193,"The best conformer, I-1-h, has a boat-like C ring which involves the peptidic carbonyl, as compared to the carboxyl carbonyl in GlyHis.",5
194,"In addition, the perpendicular orientations of the peptidic linkage and the carboxyl terminus enable the latter to interact with the N–H of imidazole, forming a C ring.",5
195,"The favourable orientation of the amino terminus towards the peptidic N–H, already described previously, also permits some interaction of one of its N–H bonds with the π cloud of imidazole.",5
196,"As seen in Table 2, this is the most stable conformer, however, it is slightly less stable than the best conformer of the N–H tautomer.",8
197,"The most stable conformer of family II, II-1-b (see Fig. 5), differs from I-1-h by the orientation of the Gly backbone, with the terminal carbonyl interacting with the peptidic N–H rather than with N–H.",5
198,"This is a weaker interaction, essentially a dipole–dipole interaction of the CO and N–H bonds with antiparallel dipoles, rather than a H bond.",5
199,"As a consequence, it is less stable than I-1-h by 5 kJ mol.",8
200,"The next two conformers (not shown) are higher congeners of family I, differing from I-1-h only by the orientation of the COOH group.",8
201,They are less stable than I-1-h by 6–8 kJ mol.,8
202,"The next most stable structure is the first of family III (III-4-h, see Fig. 5).",8
203,"It has a C ring as does I-1-h, but with a different conformation (of type a for III-4-h), in which the C ring no longer exists.",5
204,"Although the amino terminus –N–H peptidic bond interaction is maintained, together with that of one amino N–H with the π cloud of imidazole, the lack of the C ring leads to a destabilization of 12 kJ mol.",5
205,"Structure IV-1-h, the next higher conformer, presents a b-type C ring, no C ring, and has no amino N–H-imidazole stabilization.",5
206,It is about 1 kJ mol less stable than III-4-h.,8
207,"Several conformers belonging to the III, IV and I families follow with increasing energies, and the first members of families V-VIII (shown in Fig. 5) are all at least 20 kJ mol less stable than I-1-h.",8
208,The relative energies of all conformers found are gathered in the right part of Table 2.,8
209,The structures of the most stable conformers for each of the seven families identified are shown in Fig. 6.,8
210,"The best structure, I-1-a, involves a C ring in a half-chair conformation (as do the next two most stable, I-1-f and I-1-b).",8
211,"The amino terminus is both a H bond donor, to N, and an acceptor, from the peptidic N–H.",5
212,"As discussed above, the latter interaction is common in low energy structures.",5
213,The carboxyl terminus adopts a  conformation to act as a H bond donor to the peptidic carbonyl.,5
214,"Its other typical,  conformation, is adopted in I-1-f, which is 7 kJ mol less stable.",8
215,"Thus here again, the most stable structure involves a  carboxylic acid.",5
216,"The first member of family II, II-1-i, is the fourth most stable overall.",8
217,"Its ring is a C, and it is now the carboxyl terminus in its  conformation which behaves as a H bond donor towards the N.",5
218,"Again the amino terminus can accept H bonding from the peptidic N–H, however, both carbonyl oxygen are left without significant interaction, leading to an energy 10 kJ mol higher than that of I-1-a.",5
219,"While the C ring was clearly the most favorable for the three previous isomers, in this case the only possibility to form a C is to bind the peptidic N–H bond to the N, which is incompatible with H bond donation of the peptidic N–H to the amino terminus.",5
220,"Not only is the C not the best ring in this case, but the most stable conformer bearing a C, III-2-b, is found to lie 15 kJ mol higher than I-1-a.",8
221,"The first member of family IV, IV-3-b, has a conformation very close to that of III-2-b.",8
222,They differ only by the C conformation (half-chair-like in IV-3-b).,8
223,"Another C occurs in family V, V-2-a, with the same C conformation as in IV-3.",8
224,The difference consists in the perpendicular orientation of the acid function with respect to the peptidic plane (third descriptor).,5
225,"This orientation allows the carboxyl group in  conformation to make a H bond to the peptidic carbonyl, instead of being  and bind electrostatically with the peptidic N–H (as in IV-3-b).",5
226,"As a balance of these changes, the energies of these three conformers III-2-b, IV-3-b and V-2-a are very close and differ only by 3 kJ mol.",8
227,Amino acids are known to have zwitterionic structures in aqueous solution in the biologically significant range of pH (. 6–9).,1
228,"In the gas phase, the positive and negative charges cannot be as efficiently stabilized as they are in solution, and the zwitterions are expected to be much less stable.",1
229,"In fact, all available evidences point to structures without formal charges in the gas phase.",1
230,"Thus we expect that for dipeptides such as HisGly and GlyHis, zwitterions are not the most stable isomers either.",7
231,Yet it was deemed necessary to check this issue computationally.,9
232,The number of stable conformers for the zwitterions of the tautomers of HisGly and GlyHis is expected to be significantly smaller than for the “neutral” structures described above.,7
233,Preliminary calculations indeed showed that many structures lead to collapse to non-zwitterions.,5
234,"As expected, the most favorable structures involve direct interaction between one of the carboxylate oxygens and one of the ammonium N–H bonds.",5
235,"For such motifs to be stable against proton transfer from the ammonium to the carboxylate, at least one of the charges must be stabilized by a second hydrogen bond, for instance O by the imidazole N–H, or N–H by the imidazole N.",1
236,"In all cases, the zwitterions were found to be much less stable than many conformers without formal charges.",5
237,"The smallest difference found between the best zwitterion and the best “neutral” conformer is for the N–H tautomer of HisGly, where it is 89 kJ mol.",8
238,This zwitterion happens to have a structure that is fairly similar to that reported for the crystal structure of the hemihydrate of HisGly.,5
239,"Since all zwitterions are so high in energy, they are not described further here for the sake of brevity.",1
240,All of the low energy structures determined in this work (in a range of . 20 kJ mol) bear a C ring.,5
241,"Moreover, this ring is a C in the most stable conformers of three out of the four isomers.",5
242,"In these three cases, the ring conformation is boat-like.",8
243,"Clearly whenever the skeleton is compatible with such a motif, it is highly favorable.",5
244,"A feature that is common to all four lowest energy conformers, is the N-terminus conformation, in which the amino group is a H bond acceptor from the peptidic N–H bond.",5
245,"Finally, in three out of the four cases, maximizing the strength of hydrogen bonding leads to a  carboxyl group being present in the most stable conformer, even though it is intrinsically much less stable than the  conformer.",5
246,"As expected, though, the specificities of the various isomers are such that not all of the descriptors can take similar values for all most stable conformers.",5
247,"The relative orientations of the peptide linkage and the carboxyl group, the relative orientations of the Gly skeleton and the imidazole ring, and the  or  conformation of the carboxyl group, lead to structures that are significantly different, in order to optimize the network of hydrogen bonds.",4
248,"Comparison of the energies of the most stable conformers, for the N–H and N–H tautomers, indicate that the most favorable tautomer of GlyHis is the N–H, while that for HisGly is the N–H.",4
249,"The energy differences are 4 and 1 kJ mol for GlyHis and HisGly, respectively, at the MP2/6-311+G(2d,2p)//HF/6-31G* level, including ZPE correction.",8
250,"Such values are too small to draw a safe conclusion regarding the lowest energy tautomers, therefore they were recomputed with more accurate geometries and final energetics.",4
251,"At the MP2/6-311+G(2d,2p)//MP2/6-31G* level, the energy differences between the tautomers are found to be slightly increased, to 5 kJ mol for both GlyHis and HisGly.",8
252,"At the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ(-f)//MP2/6-31G* level, they increase again, and amount to 7 kJ mol for GlyHis and 8 kJ mol for HisGly.",8
253,These results leave little doubt that the most stable tautomer is N–H for GlyHis and N–H for HisGly.,4
254,"The low energy conformation spaces for the sodium complexes of the four isomers are expected to be significantly restricted as compared to those of the free peptides, since previous studies have shown that multidentate binding of Na is a strong stability factor in its complexes with amino acids and oligopeptides.",7
255,"For GlyGly, it was shown that the most stable structures involve ion interaction with both carbonyl oxygens, differing by the interaction, or lack thereof, with the amino terminus.",1
256,"In GlyHis and HisGly, our results above suggest that for the N–H tautomers, the imidazole N nitrogen may be an additional chelation site.",7
257,"It may also be anticipated that interaction of sodium with part or all of the imidazole π electrons will introduce an alternative binding capability, open to both types of tautomers.",7
258,"Because the number of low-energy structures is much less for sodium complexes than for free peptides, we do not introduce descriptors, and mostly describe the structures in terms of the sodium chelation sites and intramolecular H binding they involve.",6
259,The principles summarized above are illustrated by the relative energies of the most stable structures (see Table 3 and Fig. 8): the most favorable chelation of sodium is to both carbonyl oxygens and the imidazole ring.,5
260,"Since strong binding to N is sterically impossible, the ion interacts with the π cloud of imidazole.",5
261,"In both I and II, Na is bound to both carbonyl oxygens, and sits above the plane of imidazole, with closer interaction with one of the CN bonds.",5
262,"The two structures differ by the orientation of the NH terminus: it interacts with the peptidic N–H in I, while it is a H-bond acceptor from the imidazole N–H in II.",5
263,The distances from sodium to its chelation partners are almost the same in both cases.,8
264,I is more stable than II by 12 kJ mol.,8
265,"A third structure of the same type, III, differs from I by the terminal acid which is  in I and  in III, with the O–H bond pointing towards the peptidic nitrogen.",8
266,"Since the latter is not a particularly strong H bond acceptor, III is less stable than I by 20 kJ mol.",5
267,"A fourth structure, V, is also bound to sodium  the same sites as I, II and III.",8
268,It now has the NH terminus interacting with the peptidic CO.,5
269,"As seen above for the conformations of the free peptides, this is less favorable for NH than interacting with the peptidic N–H.",5
270,"V is less stable than I by 28 kJ mol, and is essentially degenerate with structure IV, in which the peptidic CO is H-bound to the N–H of imidazole rather than to sodium as in the previous cases.",5
271,"The remaining, less stable structures of this isomer (V, VI and VII) all have sodium bound to the two carbonyl oxygens only.",8
272,"In all cases, the peptidic N–H bond interacts with both the NH terminus and imidazole in varying orientations.",5
273,"These three structures have similar energies, 30–40 kJ mol higher than that of I.",8
274,"Here as for the N–H tautomer above, the most stable structures involve chelation to both carbonyl oxygen (see Table 3 and Fig. 9).",8
275,"However the most favorable binding mode of Na to imidazole is no longer to the π cloud, but rather to the N nitrogen.",5
276,"This tridentate binding is found in I, II, IV and VI.",5
277,"In the lowest three of these structures, the NH terminus is in its most favorable conformation, interacting with the peptidic N–H.",5
278,I and II differ by the side chain conformation of His.,8
279,"In I it is such that imidazole is closer to the C terminus, while it is closer to the main chain and peptidic carbonyl in II.",8
280,I and II are isoenergetic.,5
281,"II and IV share a similar main chain conformation, however, in IV the C terminus acid is in its less favorable  conformation.",5
282,"This enables interaction of the acid O–H with the peptidic nitrogen, albeit not strongly enough to compensate for the acid destabilization.",5
283,"A better compromise is obtained in III, where Na interacts with the carbonyl oxygens and the N terminus nitrogen.",8
284,"Here the acid is  as in IV, with the O–H now pointing towards the N of imidazole.",8
285,This leads to favorable H binding with a O–H⋯N bond angle of 164°.,5
286,Yet this structure is less stable than I by 14 kJ mol.,8
287,"Another type of intramolecular H bond is found in V and VII, in which it is the peptidic N–H which binds to the N.",8
288,"These two structures have very similar backbones, with both carbonyls bound to Na.",5
289,"They mostly differ by the conformation of the N terminus, and it is the interaction of NH with Na (in V) rather than with the peptidic N–H (in VII) which is the most favourable.",5
290,"Finally, VI differs from II by the NH conformation, and as seen several times before, H donation to the peptidic CO is less favourable than H acceptance from the peptidic N–H, by 25 kJ mol in this case.",5
291,The results are summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 10.,8
292,"As for the N–H tautomer of GlyHisNa, interaction of the ion with the N of imidazole is not possible, therefore Na interacts with the π cloud.",5
293,"However in this case, a significant difference may be seen: the most stable structure does not involve Na chelation to both carbonyls, but rather to the peptidic carbonyl and the NH terminus, and sits on top of the ring.",5
294,"This arrangement allows for efficient H bond donation from the N–H to the C terminal carbonyl oxygen, with a relatively short H⋯O distance of 2.03 Å.",5
295,"More importantly, the N–H⋯O and H⋯OC angles are 160 and 143°, respectively.",8
296,The reason why the N–H tautomer of HisGlyNa is unique is that this H bond involves a C cycle (see Scheme 2) with enough flexibility to allow for nearly optimum N–H⋯OC orientation.,5
297,"In contrast, in the GlyHisNa N–H tautomer, there is only a C or C possible between the N–H and the terminal or peptidic CO, respectively (see, , isomers IV of GlyHisNa in Fig. 8 with N–H⋯O and H⋯OC angles of 145 and 129°).",5
298,"In the N–H tautomers of GlyHisNa and HisGlyNa, the N–H bond cannot form any significant interaction; the N–H bond can indeed engage into H bonds (see, , isomers III of GlyHisNa in Fig. 9), but this can only occur at the expense of imidazole no longer being a sodium ligand.",5
299,Therefore it is only in N–H HisGlyNa that such imidazole N–H bonding can compensate for the loss of a carbonyl ligand to Na.,5
300,All other structures have Na bound to the two carbonyl oxygens and to the π cloud of imidazole.,5
301,"They differ by two main characteristics: (i) the conformation of the side chain of His is such that imidazole is closer either to the C terminus (as in II and IV) or to the peptidic chain (as in III and V), and (ii) the orientation of the amino terminus.",5
302,"The latter is a H bond acceptor from the imidazole N–H in II and III, from the C–H in IV and provides a fourth chelation site to Na in V. These four structures span an energy range of less than 20 kJ mol, while II is 6 kJ mol less stable than I.",5
303,The results are summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 11.,8
304,"As with the N–H tautomer of GlyHisNa, strong interaction of the ion with the N of imidazole is possible, so that the most favorable chelation of sodium is to both carbonyl oxygens and the N in I. Yet the next two structures in stability order, II and III, have Na bound to N, the peptidic oxygen and the amino terminus, differing only by the conformation of the C terminus.",5
305,"Both are very close in energy, 22 and 24 kJ mol higher than I. Structures IV and VI have the same tridentate chelation as I, however, now the conformation of His side chain is such that imidazole is closer to the peptidic chain, rather than to the C terminus as in I. As a consequence, the amino terminus is a H bond donor to the peptidic oxygen in IV and VI, rather than being an acceptor from the peptidic N–H as in I. These differences lead to IV and VI being less stable than I by 26 and 32 kJ mol, respectively.",5
306,"Finally, Na is only bound to two sites in V and VII.",8
307,"V is more stable than VII by 8 kJ mol, because its two ligands are the two carbonyl oxygens.",5
308,"As seen for other cases previously, it has a  acid which allows for hydrogen bonding, to the N in this case.",5
309,"Yet with only two chelation sites to Na, it is less stable than structure I by 31 kJ mol.",5
310,"A comprehensive study of the low energy structures of both tautomers of GlyHis and HisGly, and their sodium complexes has been described.",4
311,"Compared to what has been described previously in the literature for GlyGly, the side chain of His provides additional binding capability.",5
312,"While the N position is too remote for interaction, the N can engage in H bonding either as an acceptor or as a donor, depending upon the tautomer.",5
313,This capability has a strong influence on all low energy structures of the four peptides.,5
314,Maximizing the H-bonding also leads to the C-terminal carboxylic acid being in its  conformation in three out of the four cases.,5
315,"Overall, the most stable tautomer of gaseous GlyHis is found to be the N–H, while that of HisGly is the N–H, however, the energy differences are small in both cases, less than 10 kJ mol at all computational levels used.",4
316,"Because of these small differences, the picture might be significantly changed in the condensed phase, especially in a protic solvent where intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds might be in competition.",4
317,"In the sodium complexes, the N position of the imidazole side chain of His again has a strong influence on stability.",5
318,"In the N–H tautomers, N is an efficient sodium chelator or H bond acceptor, while in the N–H, it may act as an acceptor, with Na interacting with the π cloud of imidazole.",4
319,The stronger ion–molecule interactions in the N–H tautomers lead them to be the most stable in GlyHisNa and HisGlyNa.,4
320,"These results illustrate the role of environment (here, sequence effects and ion chelation) on the relative energies of His tautomers.",4
321,It is highly probable that environment effects in proteins are even stronger.,4
322,Tautomeric forms of His in X-ray diffraction structures should therefore be assigned with caution.,4

2,"Calcination at 300 °C of MgAl–WO LDH leads to amorphous species, and crystallisation of MgWO is observed at 700 °C.",8
3,"The solids calcined at 500 and 700 °C exhibit surface Lewis acid sites and are selective to acelaldehyde formation during ethanol dehydrogenation or to oxidative dehydrogenation, especially in the sample calcined at 500 °C, where carboxylate species are not detected in the temperature range tested (room temperature to 300 °C).",5
4,"Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), also known as hydrotalcites or anionic clays, are materials which can be easily synthesised by cheap methods.",1
5,"Its structure consists of Mg(OH) (brucite) layers, where a partial M/M substitution has taken place, the positive charge in excess being balanced by anions (most often carbonate) located, together with water molecules, in the interlayer.",1
6,The general formula is [MM (OH)] [A] HO.,1
7,The value of  usually ranges between 0.17 and 0.33.,1
8,"Probably, one of the most interesting properties of these materials is their ability to exchange topotactically the interlayer anions, thus permitting the synthesis of a large number of compounds.",1
9,"Many polyoxometalates (POMs) of transition metal cations (, Mo, W, V) with different structures (Keggin, Dawson or Finke type) have been incorporated into the interlayer space of anionic clays.",1
10,"The main problem found when synthesising these materials is that the precise nature of POM is pH-dependent and they are usually unstable under the basic conditions provided by the solid material, so a careful control of synthesis methods and conditions (, pH, temperature, contact time of the LDH precursor with POM, ) is required.",1
11,"Intercalation of this sort of anion, in addition to swelling (which increases the accessible surface area) permits immobilisation of the POM, and its controlled release in a polar medium.",1

20,"The mixture, under a nitrogen atmosphere, was magnetically stirred at 100 °C for 30 min and the pH was maintained at 6.5 (by adding 0.1 M HNO).",10
21,"The solid was washed several times with decarbonated water by centrifugation, filtered and dried at room temperature in a vacuum desiccator leading to sample MgAlW.",10

35,"The gas is admitted to the IR-adsorption cell at room temperature and, after 15 min equilibration, the gas phase is removed by outgassing at different temperatures (from room temperature to 400 °C) and the spectrum is recorded.",10

37,The spectra were generally recorded without prior outgassing the gas phase.,10
38,The nature of the W-containing species intercalated in sample MgAlW has been studied by different techniques and the results have been previously reported elsewhere and are here summarized.,9
39,"The PXRD diagram of sample MgAlW is shown in Fig. 1, together with that of the precursor nitrate LDH, MgAl–NO, and those of the calcined materials.",8
40,"The diagram for the uncalcined solid is characteristic of a layered material with the hydrotalcite-like structure, with a basal spacing of 10 Å (from the position of the first basal maximum below 2 = 10°) larger than that of the precursor nitrate sample (8.5 Å), indicating a swelling of the layers due to the nitrate/p-tungstate exchange.",5
41,"Due to the pH used during synthesis and from the gallery height, we concluded that the interlayer anion is WO.",4
42,"Nevertheless, the  value for this sample is smaller than that reported by other authors because of the strong interaction between the anion and the brucite-like layers, favoured by the synthesis temperature (100 °C) and the long contact time between the solution and the layered precursor used.",4
43,"No diffraction line corresponding to the MgAl–NO LDH is recorded, indicating a total exchange under the experimental conditions used.",5
44,"Sample MgAlW/500 shows a PXRD diagrams with no defined maximum, characteristic of mostly amorphous materials.",5
45,"Only after calcination at 700 °C do sharp peaks develop which become sharper when calcination is carried out at 800 °C (diagram not shown); these peaks have been ascribed to two different phases of MgWO, one corresponding to wolframite (file 27-789 of JCPDS files), where both tungsten and magnesium cations are octahedrally coordinated, and another similar phase formed upon dehydration of MgWO·HO (file 19-776 of JCPDS files), where tungsten ions are tetrahedrally coordinated and magnesium ions maintain an octahedral coordination.",5
46,"When the calcination temperature is increased to 1000 °C, only lines due to wolframite are recorded.",8
47,The diagrams are similar to those previously recorded after high temperature calcination of solids prepared by impregnation of MgO with aqueous solutions of p-tungstate salts.,5
48,"The FT-IR spectrum of sample MgAlW, Fig. 2, show bands characteristic of p-tungstate, although some of them are shifted with respect to the positions reported for the free anion, because of the interaction with the layers.",5
49,"The characteristic bands are recorded between 1000 and 500 cm at 950, 925 cm (terminal (W–O)), 878 cm (corner-sharing (W–O–W)), and 747, 670 cm (edge-sharing (W–O–W)).",5
50,"Finally, the bands recorded below 600 cm (close to 552, 447, and 391 cm) are due to traslational Al/Mg–OH modes of the brucite-like layers.",5
51,"Calcination at 500 °C leads to cancellation of the bands characteristic of polytungstate, and a broad absorption at 851 cm dominates the spectrum.",8
52,"When the calcination temperature is increased to 700 °C, Fig. 2, individual bands are recorded at 1004, 860, 801, 751, 681 cm, due to stretching W–O modes of the two phases of MgWO the presence of which has been concluded from the XRD diagram.",5

67,"After outgassing the sample  at 400 °C for 2 h, a pressure of 400 N m was equilibrated with the sample for 30 min, and the spectrum was recorded after outgassing at room temperature, 100, 200, and 300 °C.",3
68,The spectra recorded after adsorption of py on sample MgAlW calcined at 500 or 700 °C are very similar; those for sample MgAlW/500 are shown in Fig. 5.,8
69,"Bands at 1608, 1577, 1492, and 1446 cm are recorded after outgassing at room temperature.",8

71,"The intensities of the signals decrease when the outgassing temperature is increased, but are recorded even after outgassing at 300 °C, indicating that they are rather strong acid sites.",5
72,No band is recorded which could be ascribed to adsorption of py on surface Brønsted acid sites.,5
73,"Although in this study we have followed the reactive adsorption of ethanol on our solids, as acetaldehyde and acetic acid are expected oxidation products of ethanol, the adsorption of these species has been also monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy.",3
74,"The range reported extends in all cases from 1800 to 1000 cm, as the more representative bands of the adsorbed species are expected in this range.",3
75,"The spectra recorded after contacting acetic acid at room temperature with samples MgAlW/500 and MgAlW/700 are very similar, with bands at 1740, 1718, 1665, 1584, 1457, 1429, 1350, and 1295 cm.",5
76,"The two bands recorded at the highest wavenumbers (1740 and 1718 cm), together with that at 1295 cm, can be ascribed to modes (CO) and (CO)/(C–OH), respectively, of weakly, molecularly adsorbed acetic acid (the bands are recorded at 1770 and 1264 cm for gaseous acetic acid.)",5
77,"These bands disappear after gentle outgassing of the sample, indicating that the interaction should be rather weak.",5
78,The band at 1665 cm can be ascribed to the (CO) of acetic acid less weakly adsorbed on basic surface sites; this band is only removed after outgassing at higher temperatures.,5
79,"The bands at 1593, 1457, 1429, and 1350 cm are due to modes (COO), (COO) + (CH) and (CH) of acetate species bonded to surface Lewis acid sites, through a dissociative adsorption of the acid from the gaseous phase.",5
80,"These species are even strongly held on the surface, as the bands are recorded (although rather weak) after outgassing the sample at 300 °C.",5
81,The spectra recorded after adsorption of acetaldehyde at room temperature on samples MgAlW/500 (Fig. 6) and MgAlW/700 are rather similar.,5
82,"Bands at 1711, 1350, and 1130 cm are due to modes (CO), (CH), and (C–C)/(CH)/(CCO) of molecularly, non-dissociated adsorbed acetaldehyde, coordinated through the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group to surface Lewis acid sites.",5
83,"The bands at 1593, 1457, 1429, and 1350 cm are similar to those recorded after adsorption of acetic acid and are due to acetate species.",5
84,"These species can have been formed through oxidation of acetaldehyde or they can arise from a Cannizzaro disproportionation of acetaldehyde to acetate and ethoxy species, a process that has been previously reported to occur on other metal oxides.",4
85,"Such a disproportionation would account for acetate species formed even at room temperature (spectrum a in Fig. 6), and also for the bands recorded at 1400–1385 and 1100 cm, similar to those observed after adsorption of ethanol on these samples (see below), which can be ascribed to (CH) and (CO) modes of the ethoxy group.",4
86,"When the sample is heated at 100–200 °C without removal of the gas phase, bands in the same positions are recorded, although their relative intensities change: so, the intensity of the band due to weakly adsorbed acetaldehyde (1711 cm) decreases, while a new band at 1669 cm develops; this band is due to acetaldehyde adsorbed on surface Lewis acid sites.",5
87,"A new band at 1643 cm is also observed, which, together with the band at 1183 cm, can be ascribed to modes (CC) and (CO) of enolate species, CHCHO–, or, alternatively, crotonaldehyde, as a result of aldol condensation of acetaldehyde.",4
88,"Although these species are rather stable, they are observed only in the presence of undissociated acetaldehyde.",5
89,"In our case, as the cell has not been outgassed after adsorption of acetaldehyde at room temperature, their formation cannot be discarded as the temperature is raised; these bands are similar to others recorded after adsorption of acetone or acetaldehyde on different metal oxides.",4
90,"Only the bands due to ethoxy species disappear when the sample is heated at 300 °C, Fig. 6; the intensities of those due to molecularly adsorbed acetaldehyde, to crotonaldehyde or to enolate species decrease, while those ascribed to acetate species markedly increase.",5
91,These bands due to adsorbed acetate species are the only bands recorded if the sample is outgassed at room temperature after heating at 200–300 °C.,8
92,"The spectrum recorded after adsorption of ethanol at room temperature (and outgassing at the same temperature) on sample MgAlW/500 shows, Fig. 7a, in addition to those bands corresponding to (CH) and (OH) modes at high wavenumbers (not shown), bands between 1480 and 1387, 1272, 1092 cm, due to modes (CH) and (CO) of the ethoxy group, formed upon dissociative adsorption of ethanol on acid–basic surface sites of the solid; a band at 1630 cm, due to mode (HOH) of molecular water, is also recorded.",5
93,"When the sample is heated at 100 °C without outgassing, the intensities of the bands mentioned above decrease, and new, although weak, bands are recorded at 1710 and 1640 cm together with a very weak band at 1355 cm.",8
94,These bands have been recorded also after adsorption of acetaldehyde (see above) and have been ascribed to molecularly adsorbed acetaldehyde and a monomeric enol species or crotonaldehyde.,5
95,"Probably, in this case they correspond to the former species, as the concentration of acetaldehyde should be rather low.",5
96,"When the sample is further heated at 200 °C the bands due to molecular acetaldehyde strengthen (especially the bands at 1710 and 1355 cm), and a new band develops at 1669 cm, which corresponds to acetaldehyde coordinated to surface Lewis acid sites; this band is also recorded after adsorption of acetaldehyde on this sample; simultaneously, the intensities of the bands due to ethoxy species decrease, but no band due to acetate species is recorded, even if the sample is heated at 300 °C.",5
97,Bands due to acetaldehyde are removed after outgassing at 200–300 °C.,8
98,The spectra recorded after adsorption of ethanol on sample MgAlW/700 (Fig. 8) are different.,5
99,"Adsorption and outgassing at room temperature gives rise to bands exclusively due to ethoxy species, similar to those recorded after adsorption of the alcohol on sample MgAlW/500.",5
100,"When the temperature is raised to 100 or 200 °C, without simultaneous outgassing, the spectrum only shows minor changes.",5
101,"Only after heating at 300 °C, are the weak bands at 1752, 1732, and 1662 cm, due to the (CO) mode of undissociated acetaldehyde adsorbed on surface Lewis acid sites with different strengths recorded, together with bands at 1587, 1457, 1425, and 1350 cm, due to acetate species.",5
102,"Catalytic decomposition of alcohols to form carbonyl compounds on metal oxides may proceed through (i) simple dehydrogenation, where the presence of molecular oxygen is not essential, the reaction taking place on basic sites and the carbonyl compound is formed together with H, and (ii) oxidative dehydrogenation, leading to formation of the carbonyl compound and water through a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism; in this case, red-ox sites are required, as well as O for reoxidation of the catalyst.",1
103,"Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and/or acetic acid may take place on samples MgAlW/500 and MgAlW/700, where Lewis type  (W and Al) are present, as evidenced by pyridine adsorption, as well as  (OH and O), due to the presence of strongly basic Mg oxides.",5
104,"Such a surface basicity is evidenced by bands due to enolate species (CHCHO–) or crotonaldehyde detected after acetaldehyde adsorption, formation of which takes place easily on basic sites; redox sites also exist (W species).",5
105,"However, reducibility of tungsten in these solids (W → W), is very low, especially in the sample calcined at 700 °C.",5
106,"The FT-IR spectra indicate that acetaldehyde formation takes place through intermediate ethoxy species, the formation of which has been observed after adsorption of ethanol on both samples studied.",5
107,"These alcoxy species are formed as a result of dissociative adsorption of the alcohol on the acid–base sites, giving rise to new hydroxyl groups or water molecules (Scheme 1); the band corresponding to mode (HO) at 1630 cm is only observed upon adsorption of ethanol on sample MgAlW/500.",5
108,"As already mentioned, evolution of ethoxy species to formaldehyde takes place through simple or oxidative dehydrogenation.",5
109,"As the reducibility of tungsten species is very low in sample MgAlW/700, it may be suggested that on this sample acetaldehyde is formed following the simple dehydrogenation route (Scheme 2), which is favoured in the presence of basic sites.",4
110,"However, in the case of sample MgAlW/500, in addition to this type of dehydrogenation an oxidative dehydrogenation (Scheme 3) is also possible, because of the larger reducibility of this sample, following a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen acts as the oxidant species.",4
111,"Formation of acetaldehyde takes place at lower temperatures on sample MgAlW/500 than on sample MgAlW/700, and acetate species are not detected on the former sample.",5
112,"Consequently, sample MgAlW/500 may be a good selective catalyst for acetaldehyde formation, as this species desorbs without further oxidation.",4
113,"On the contrary, acetaldehyde is formed, together with stable acetate species, on sample MgAlW/700 at higher temperatures ( 300 °C) these acetate species can undergo decomposition to CO, thus decreasing the selectivity to acetaldehyde.",5
114,The catalytic behaviour of sample MgAlW/700 is similar to that previously observed for WO/MgO samples prepared by impregnation.,4
115,"As acid–base and structural properties are very similar for both samples, the different selectivity for acetaldehyde formation can be related to the different dispersion of the tungsten-containing active phase (magnesium tungstates).",4
116,"The PXRD pattern of sample MgAlW/500 does not evidence formation of crystalline phases, and only amorphous ones (more easily reduced) should be formed; however, the presence of MgWO crystalline species (less easily reduced) in sample MgAlW/700 only permits a simple dehydrogenation at higher temperatures.",4
117,"On the other hand, Cannizzaro disproportionation of acetaldehyde to ethoxy and acetate species has been observed on both samples only at room temperature or at 100 °C, in the presence of gaseous acetaldehyde.",4
0,Role of water molecules in the KcsA protein channel by molecular dynamics calculations,9
1,Molecular dynamics simulations supported by electrostatic calculations have been conducted on the KcsA channel to determine the role of water molecules in the pore.,0
2,"Starting from the X-ray structure of the KcsA channel in its closed state at 2.0 Å resolution, the opening of the pore towards a conformation built on the basis of EPR results is studied.",9
3,We show that water molecules act as a structural element for the K ions inside the filter and the hydrophobic cavity of the channel.,5
4,"In the filter, water tends to enhance the depth of the wells occupied by the K ions, while in the cavity there is a strong correlation between the water molecules and the cavity ion.",5
5,"As a consequence, the protein remains very stable in the presence of three K ions in the selectivity filter and one in the cavity.",4
6,"The analysis of the dynamics of water molecules in the cavity reveals preferred orientations of the dipoles along the pore axis, and a correlated behavior between this dipole orientation and the displacement of the K ion during the gating process.",4
7,The equilibrium and dynamical properties of a solvent in confined geometry can be very different from those in the bulk.,1
8,"This is particularly important in the case of confined environments present in proteins, such as the interior of deep crevices, pockets or other poorly accessible regions.",1
9,Prominent examples include the substrate binding sites of enzymes and the narrow pores of membrane channels.,1
10,"Simulation studies of a number of channel models with cylindrical shapes have suggested that the average dynamical properties of water molecules in a protein pore differ substantially from those in bulk water, exhibiting in particular decreased translational and rotational mobility.",1
11,Molecular dynamics (MD) has been used to simulate the behavior of water molecules located between two planar hydrophobic surfaces or within cylindrical and spherical cavities.,1
12,"These studies have shown that water confined in such molecular sized volumes displays a greater degree of order than in bulk, with the formation of distinct layers of molecules parallel to the surfaces.",1
13,"This confinement changes the dielectric constant of the solvent which, in turn, influences the effective electrostatic field within the liquid.",1
14,"The situation becomes more complicated when we consider ionic channels since, in addition to the influence of the confinement due to the specific geometry of the polypeptide chains, much larger variations of the dielectric constant are obtained due to the solvation of ions, like K, present in the channel.",1
15,There are few experimental measurements of the solvent dielectric constant within a protein pore.,1
16,"Let us cite for instance experimental studies of a water pool confined in reverse micelles and biological pores, which have revealed a substantial decrease of polarization and a dramatic slowing of the rate of relaxation of water molecules.",1
17,The behavior of water molecules bound within a cyclodextrine cycle has also been found to be very different from that in bulk water.,1
18,"Due to these specific properties relating dielectric behavior and confinement, water is becoming more and more understood as a structuring element in proteins, and  calculations have been used to prove this feature.",1
19,Frey and Cleland  have reviewed the evidence supporting the idea that short and strong hydrogen bonds could provide at least five orders of magnitude in rate acceleration of enzymatic catalysis.,1
20,Green has proposed that a partially charged HO group could strongly block a voltage-gated channel by preventing motions of transmembrane helices.,1
21,"In this paper we refer to a pH-gated K channel from , the KcsA channel.",1
22,The past few years have witnessed the determination of the structure of several species of ion channels by X-ray diffraction and by cryoelectron microscopy.,1
23,"In particular, there has been substantial advances in the structural determination of potassium channels.",1
24,"Combined with a large number of numerical studies, these structures provide an opportunity to relate atomic resolution structures (3.2 and 2.0 Å resolution for KcsA) to their various physiological functions (selectivity, gating, permeation, )..",1
25,"In previous studies, we have built a model for the open and closed structures of KcsA based on the 2.0 Å resolution structure.",1
26,We have conducted MD simulations based on the idea that this channel could support several K ions in its pore.,1
27,"Based on simplified arguments, four K ions were assumed to occupy the pore, being alternately separated by water molecules.",1
28,Their locations were chosen to be consistent with the sites determined experimentally.,1
29,This so-called KWKWK…K sequence was proved to be stable over nanosecond time scales in either the closed or open state of the channel.,1
30,"In this paper, we try to explain this choice in a more quantitative way by investigating the structural role of the protein and water on the K ions properties.",0
31,The specific dynamical behavior of water molecules in the hydrophobic cavity found in KcsA has been described for the closed conformation of the pore.,1
32,We have conducted similar studies and tried to elucidate the correlation between the motions of the K ions located in the cavity with the orientation of the water molecule in the closed and open structures.,0
33,The complexity of ion channels is such that information extracted from computational models can greatly contribute to the refinement of our understanding of their physiological properties in the cell and  to better apprehend ion channel diseases.,2
34,MD simulations on protein with explicit solvents and membranes and Brownian dynamics based on a simplified description of the pore have been used to study ion permeation at the microscopic level.,3
35,"Nonetheless all these models, at any level, contain more or less severe approximations.",3
36,"In particular, it is well known that electrostatics plays a dominant role for the protein structure and function including transmembrane architectures.",3
37,"Macroscopic continuum electrostatic models, in which the solvent is described as a structureless dielectric medium, are particularly useful to reveal the dominant energetic factors related to ion permeation, but they occult the specific role of individual water molecules in confined zones.",3
38,"This is what we want to stress by using KcsA, which is a nice example as it exhibits different types of water pockets.",0
39,"In this section, we briefly describe our KcsA models for the open and closed states and the MD protocols we used.",1
40,Details can be found elsewhere.,1
41,We have built open and closed state models of the KcsA channel on the basis of experimental results.,3
42,"The closed conformation of KcsA, as revealed by X-ray experiments at 100 K, is a tetramer formed by four outer helices M, pore helices P and inner helices M (Fig. 1).",1
43,Three main regions appear in this protein.,1
44,"The narrowest part of the pore, formed by the backbone carbonyl oxygens of the amino acid sequence TVGYG (Thr75–Val76–Gly77–Tyr78–Gly79), acts as a selectivity filter (F) for the K ions.",1
45,It extends over about 12 Å with a mean radius of 1.4 Å.,1
46,"At the membrane center, the size of the pore increases to form a 5 Å radius hydrophobic cavity (C).",1
47,"The gate (G), which is a thin hydrophobic region formed by the inner M helix bundle, closes the channel with a zone of small radius (about 1.6 Å) on the intracellular side.",1
48,Very little is known about the open state of KcsA and the relationship between the structure and gating mechanism.,1
49,"Homology modeling with MthK and KvAP, which are nicely representative of the open state of the KcsA pore conformation, could have been used as a starting basic structure.",1
50,"Also, direct experiments on KcsA using site-directed labeling and EPR spectroscopy allowed the visualization of the structural rearrangements of the intracellular M helices in the process from closed to open state.",1
51,"The crystallized structure of KcsA (1JQ2), averaged over 50 protein configurations was improved by additional energy minimization using molecular mechanics to obtain the 1JQ1 structure.",1
52,"Three main experimental conformations (homology based structures, 1JQ2 and 1JQ1) could thus be considered as starting structures in an optimization process to reach a stable open state for KcsA.",1
53,"Although none of these structures are totally resolved, 1JQ1 has been chosen as being the most representative.",6
54,"Moreover, the positions of several  atoms of M helices occurring in the gate region are known in a precise way (Leu86 to Gln119 for the first monomer and their analogues in the other three monomers).",1
55,We have thus built a model of the open structure combining the  known skeleton positions of the open structure derived from EPR experiments and the well-defined closed structure modeled on the basis of X-ray data.,6
56,The diameter of the narrowest part of the gate in the permeation path was estimated to be about 5 Å.,1
57,"Nevertheless, there is currently a controversy with respect to this value which seems, on the view of Brownian dynamics results, too small to allow for fast K diffusion motions comparable to experimental observations.",1
58,The lipid bilayer of the cellular membrane (hydrophobic area) is mimicked by an octane box.,6
59,"Of course octane molecules are not amphiphilic and cannot reproduce all the properties of a real membrane aligned phospholipids bilayer ( different viscosity, stability, interactions with the protein) but both have nearly the same density and exhibit the same hydrophobic character.",6
60,The extracellular and intracellular sides of the octane box are formed by slabs of water molecules of 22 Å thickness.,6
61,We have already stressed that we must distinguish the behavior of the water molecules belonging to the intra- and extracellular areas from that of the molecules which hydrate the cavity.,6
62,"Therefore we fixed the density of bulk water in the extra- and intracellular sides to 1, while the density of water molecules in the cavity was determined by evaluating the Connolly surface.",6
63,"As a consequence a bulk water molecule, which occupies on average a volume of 30 Å at 300 K, has its mobility appreciably reduced in the cavity.",6
64,This is correlated to a strong increase in water density (≥1).,6
65,The cavity could thus contain between 30 and 40 water molecules.,6
66,"The fluctuations of this number initially optimized in the closed state of KcsA were studied during the gating of the channel, in consistency with the conditions required for the hydration properties of potassium ion.",6
67,Indeed MD studies using the 3.2 Å resolution structure have shown that the K ion retrieves its complete solvation shell (8 water molecules) when the cavity is filled by at least 30 water molecules.,6
68,"As already mentioned, the pore axis at the filter level contains both K ions and water molecules.",6
69,"Among the seven ionic sites observed in the 2.0 Å resolution structure (2 extracellular sites S and S and 5 sites S to S) inside the channel, we deal with sites S to S because S only appears at high K concentration.",6
70,"Inside the filter, the filling sequence alternates, with two K ions being separated by a water molecule in order to increase the solvation of the K ions.",6
71,"Although this quasi-linear sequence remains intuitive, its existence could be better understood by considering a steric effect (the K radius and the average radius of a water molecule are close, equal to 1.33 and 1.41 Å, respectively) and the strong repulsive interaction occurring between nearest neighbor K ions.",1
72,"On the basis of such qualitative arguments, our sequence KWKWK…K was composed of 2 water molecules (named W and W) in the S and S sites and 4 potassium ions (1 extracellular, K, 2 ions inside the filter, K and K, and 1 in the cavity, K, otherwise filled by water molecules) at the S, S, S and S crystallographic sites, respectively.",6
73,The simulations were performed with the AMBER suite of programs using the AMBER6 force field.,10
74,The open and closed conformations were relaxed over at least 1 ns so that local minima could be ruled out.,10
75,The water molecules were described by the parameters of the TIP3P model.,6
76,"Time steps of 1 fs were required to describe all external movements, including the water rotations.",10
77,"For the closed state, we have first proceeded with the solvent (water + octane) dynamics at 300 K in order to optimize the environment of the protein, the latter being frozen in its crystallized structure.",10
78,"In a second step, MD of the protein has been performed by increasing progressively the temperature up to 300 K during ≈200 ps.",10
79,This simulation was continued in the (NVT) and (NPT) ensembles during 3.4 additional ns in order to follow the approach proposed by Bernèche,10
80,This time was shown to be sufficient to reach equilibrium for the protein built on the basis of the 3.2 Å resolution structure.,1
81,The temperature was maintained to a constant value using Berendsen’s thermal coupling at 1 fs relaxation time.,10
82,Targeted MD was conducted during about 3 ns to find an open state structure of the protein.,10
83,"Starting from the experimental structure 1JQ1 discussed previously, containing the KWKWK…K sequence, we progressively increased a constraint applied to each  atom, for reaching the open conformation.",10
84,"This conformation was finally relaxed by releasing the constraint partially, then totally.",10
85,"This approach displays two main advantages over previous simulations already devoted to the gating of the KcsA channel: (i) the refined structure of the protein contains 24 additional aminoacids at the intracellular side of the membrane, which are pointed out here as dominant for the gating mechanism; (ii) the gating mechanism is monitored step by step as a function of the constraint in an all-atom description of the pore.",3
86,"As shown in Fig. 1, the filter is not affected by the opening process, whereas the M helices participate strongly in it.",8
87,"During the relaxation, the filter remains stable while M and M helices tend to move slightly toward closing, indicating that the pore is still significantly opened after 1.5 ns (remember that the experimental gating occurs on a millisecond time scale).",5
88,The energy profiles have been obtained by calculating the potential energy of a positive (+1e) probe charge mimicking the K ion displaced adiabatically along the central () axis of the pore.,6
89,"Lennard-Jones interactions between the protein atoms, water molecules and potassium ions have also been added.",6
90,Energy minimization at a given  position was made along the other directions perpendicular to the channel axis in order to follow the most favorable energetic pathway.,6
91,The components of the dipole moment generated by the set of water molecules in the cavity were determined by following the orientation of all of these water molecules.,6
92,The projection  of the dipole moment of each water molecule onto the  axis could then be calculated.,6
93,"Note that for an ideal TIP3P water molecule, the dipole moment is equal to 2.35 D.",6
94,Quantum calculations have been performed on a model of the selectivity filter containing 304 atoms.,1
95,"We truncated the KcsA structure at the level of the four Tyr78 residues, where the peptide bond with Gly79 was cut and ended with a hydrogen (–CHO), while near the cavity below the four Thr74, –NH of the amide bond was completed in NH.",6
96,The portion of the sequence considered was thus (Thr74–Thr75–Val76–Gly77–Tyr78).,6
97,The atomic positions were issued from MD relaxed structures.,6
98,"No further energy minimization was done, in order to be strictly consistent with the MD results as for the geometries.",6
99,No lipidic or water environment constitutive of the MD construct was considered.,6
100,We used GAUSSIAN03 suite of programs to evaluate the electrostatic potential.,10
101,"Partial charges were fitted to reproduce the electrostatic potential surface using 6-31G(d) Hartree–Fock wave functions, with constraint of total charge conservation and following the Merz–Kollman–Singh scheme.",6
102,Determining partial charges is in general a difficult task.,1
103,"However, Merz–Kollman–Singh population analysis was proved to be efficient in determining such charges since it takes into account several molecular properties.",1
104,"Fig. 2 shows the trajectories of the centers of mass of the K ions and of the water molecules in the KWKWK…K sequence observed in the relaxed closed (Fig. 2a) and open (Fig. 2b) structures during 3.6 and 1.6 ns of the MD production run, respectively.",8
105,Four main features can be extracted from these trajectories.,8
106,"First, the species located in the filter are strongly bound to the protein since they do not move significantly.",5
107,"Indeed, in the closed state, the motions of W, K, W and K are contained on average in spheres of diameters ranging between 2.7 and 4 Å.",5
108,This behavior has been corroborated in our previous studies by the calculation of the root mean square displacements (rmsd).,5
109,"These display very low values, from 0.5 Å in NVT conditions to 1.3 Å in NPT conditions, indicating very confined positions.",5
110,"Second, it should be noted that the spheres belonging to the trajectories of two adjacent species overlap.",8
111,This does not mean that repulsive interactions always occur but rather shows that the atoms move in the filter in a concerted manner.,5
112,"Indeed, a close examination of the time dependent correlation functions of their instantaneous positions already confirmed these concerted motions within the KWKWK…K file.",5
113,"The third main feature concerns the K ion, which undergoes much larger motions.",8
114,"In the closed state, its trajectory extends over 9.8 Å along the pore axis and 7.2 Å in the perpendicular directions.",8
115,"In the open state, similar trends are obtained with the respective values 11.8 Å along the pore axis and 9.1 Å in the other directions.",8
116,"Fourth, and perhaps most notable, the average location of the K ion changes between the two structures.",8
117,"While in the closed state, this K ion remains on average close to the cavity site,  located at the upper part of the cavity as determined experimentally, but it shifts down toward the intracellular side of the cavity in the open configuration.",5
118,The difference between the center of gravity of the K trajectories in the two situations (closed and open) is equal to about 5.4 Å.,8
119,"Finally, let us mention that the large dispersion in the K and W locations observed at the outer mouth of the open structure when compared to the closed state may indicate an escape of these species from the pore.",4
120,"In this section, we analyze the structuring role of water in the filter and the cavity.",9
121,Fig. 3 shows the potential energy created by the protein alone in the open and closed conformations calculated along the  axis by minimization of the displacement of a K ion.,8
122,"Since the filter does not exhibit strong deformation upon gating, this energy is nearly the same in the two conformations.",5
123,"The curves display a deep well in the filter, with a structured shape at the well bottom, indicating the presence of sites.",5
124,"In the cavity and gate regions, no stable site is found for the two conformations, the main difference being obtained for the height of the barrier at the gate, which decreases by about 2 eV in the open state.",5
125,Fig. 4 exhibits the potential energy created by the filter at various  positions of a single K ion for the closed conformation of the protein.,8
126,The energy has been calculated for the protein alone with three different methods to test their accuracy.,8
127,The first curve (black dots) corresponds to the potential energy extracted directly from  calculations.,8
128,"The second (dark grey line, blue in the html) is calculated on the basis of the Merz–Kollman charges derived from this  potential while the last (light grey line, red in the html) is derived directly from the AMBER force field parameters (see Fig. 3).",8
129,"Fig. 4 reveals that all the three methods display the same behavior, namely a deep structured well at the center of the filter.",5
130,Similar depths and shapes for the wells obtained from the three methods reinforce the fact that the semi-empirical force fields used in MD simulations are reasonable enough to describe the protein environment from the point of view of the potential energy.,4
131,"We will therefore discuss our results on the basis of the AMBER force field, since  calculations are in practice too time consuming for systems containing more than 300 atoms.",9
132,"Although the secondary minima are more or less pronounced according to the method, this comparison clearly demonstrates that the well depth is mostly due to the electrostatic interactions between the ion and the 8 carbonyl groups coming from Val55 and Gly56 in their neighboring environment.",4
133,"Indeed, the position of the minima correspond exactly in the three cases to the sites S, S and S determined by MD.",4
134,However it would be premature to claim at this stage that the protein field determines fully the sites and one fundamental aspect is to precisely define the influence of water.,4
135,"Fig. 5 exhibits the potential energy (calculated with the AMBER force field) when two water molecules W and W are included in the filter at their preferred sites S and S, and in addition when the cavity is hydrated.",8
136,Comparison of the curves including or not the presence of water in the filter and cavity reveals its structuring role.,5
137,Indeed the previous locations are clearly reinforced by the presence of the two water molecules in S and S since the energy experienced by the ions in sites S and S decreases by at least 0.5 eV.,5
138,Even more indicative is the reinforcement of site S as well as the occurrence of a new site corresponding exactly to the S position.,5
139,The presence of S is enhanced by the W water molecule.,8
140,"The occurrence of S would be due to an organization of the water molecules and to the influence on the protein environment itself, both inducing the corresponding well.",4
141,"As a short conclusion to this section, one can say that the water molecules in these confined positions (filter and cavity) undoubtedly play a dominant structuring role for the K crossing the channel.",4
142,"They act first by enhancing the structure of the stable filter sites for the potassium ions, already partially outlined by the field of the protein alone, and second by revealing the cavity and S sites.",4
143,"It should also be noted that the sites S and S were found stable in the closed state of the pore, on the time scale of our simulation, only if one K additional site is present in the cavity.",4
144,"In Fig. 6, the time evolution of the components of the total dipole moment of the water molecules located in the cavity, defined as the geometrical sum of all individual HO dipoles, is shown for the closed and open states.",8
145,A positive sign for  means that the dipole is oriented along the pore axis towards the extracellular side.,8
146,"This quite noisy evolution is due to several factors: the atom fluctuations in the protein, the K motions and the thermal fluctuations in the orientational motions of light water molecules at 300 K. However, we can note that the dipoles projected along the directions perpendicular to the pore axis get close to zero on average while the component along the  axis reaches finite values.",4
147,"A relatively stable mean value of −10 D is obtained for the closed conformation while a +11 D value is reached in the open state with, however, much larger fluctuations and thus relatively large standard deviations from the average value.",5
148,"As a consequence, we expect for the open situation a large fluctuating electric field promoted by the water dipoles in the cavity.",4
149,"In order to interpret these features, different hypotheses can be drawn.",1
150,These finite values can be due to the dynamics of confined waters which cannot rotate freely in this hydrophobic pocket.,4
151,This could also be due to the electric field created by the protein which would tend to orient the dipoles along a given direction.,4
152,"Finally, the field induced by the K ion may also play an important role.",4
153,"Furthermore, we studied the electric field induced by the protein alone along the pore axis (not shown).",9
154,This quantity can be viewed as the gradient of the potential energy discussed previously (Fig. 3).,9
155,Similar behaviors are obtained for the closed and open conformations.,8
156,"However, a large difference occurs at the gate region where a global inversion of the electric field can be observed.",5
157,"Indeed for the closed structure, mainly positive values of the field indicate that K ions will be pushed toward the cavity.",4
158,"On the contrary, K ions will be pushed toward the intracellular side in the open state since the electric field exhibits mostly negative values.",4
159,"This feature corroborates the fact that two positions of K are observed in the MD simulations, namely in the upper (closed state) or lower (open state) part of the cavity (Fig. 2), which is certainly also linked to the different mean orientations of the water molecule dipoles in the cavity.",4
160,A closer examination of the dynamical behavior of the water molecules leads to another interesting feature.,9
161,Fig. 7 characterizes the dependence of the  component of the total dipole of water molecules in the cavity . the K motions along the  axis of the cavity.,8
162,"This component  clearly follows the behavior of K, being relatively stable when K does not move and, on the contrary, changing its value with the ion motion.",5
163,"As a consequence, the orientational motions of the water molecules are more or less characterized by the ion dynamics.",4
164,"Similar conclusions apply to the open channel with, however, larger fluctuations for K displacement and water dipole component values.",4
165,"To demonstrate such a correlation between the water dipole and the K motions along the  axis, we have drawn (bottom of Fig. 7) the behavior of . the position  of the ion center of mass in the cavity.",0
166,We see three sets of points for the closed and open conformations which describe relatively well the coupled behavior .  (K position).,5
167,"In the closed state, the ion K is mainly located at the upper side of the cavity around 41.5 ± 1 Å, and the corresponding dipole due to water molecules in the cavity takes values which range between 0 and −20 D, with a mean value around −10 D, as already given.",5
168,"The center of the cavity, around 38 ± 1 Å, is much less occupied by the K ion and corresponds to a dipole ranging between −10 and +10 D with a vanishing mean value.",5
169,The third region at the lower side of the cavity (35 ± 1 Å) is still less explored by the ion and it leads to a positive dipole whose value fluctuates significantly.,5
170,"In the open state, we recover the three regions, but with an occupation for the K ion which is totally reversed.",5
171,"Indeed, the ion remains mainly located at the bottom of the cavity (≈31–34 Å) and the water dipole is clearly positive.",5
172,"The other two regions correspond either to a K location close to the center of the cavity (around 37–38 Å) or to the gate region (around 29 Å), with positive values for the water dipole, respectively small (around 0 D) and large (20–25 D), respectively.",5
173,"The distribution of points describing  ((K)) displays a relatively large standard deviation, with regard to the straight lines (Fig. 7).",5
174,These lines would correspond to vanishing fluctuations in the correlation between  and (K).,5
175,Fig. 8 shows snapshots of the pore in the closed and open states.,8
176,We can see an illustrative example of what we described before.,8
177,The two K ions in the filter are similarly located in the two states while the K ion occupies drastically different positions.,5
178,A striking feature is the location of the water molecules in the cavity.,8
179,"In the first situation (closed state), they are all located below the ion, and thus hydrate it only partially.",5
180,"This means that preferential binding occurs with the innermost part of the filter, with the resulting water dipole component  taking a strongly negative value (−19 D).",5
181,"On the contrary, in the second situation (open state), the water molecules are more equally distributed around the ion, due to the pore opening, and the corresponding dipole value becomes strongly positive (+33 D)( toward the extracellular side).",5
182,"In the open state, some water molecules are also located in the gate part, suggesting entry or exit from the cavity, while no similar behavior is observed in the closed state.",5
183,"In order to study the influence of the gating mechanism, which initiates relatively large motions of the K ion in the cavity, on the behavior of the water molecules motions, we have calculated (Fig. 9) the variation of the number of HO molecules present in the cavity.",0
184,"Here, we have to define the limits of the cavity.",1
185,We considered that the upper side of the cavity corresponds to Thr74 while the lower side ends at the Ala108 residue.,6
186,"In the closed state, this number is nearly constant and equal to about 31 (not shown).",6
187,"The relaxation process which follows the constrained opening induces some perturbations at the beginning of the simulation run, resulting in a large fluctuation of the number from 22 to 30.",8
188,These perturbations disappear after 0.5 ns of simulation to display a constant number of water molecules (around 32 HO) in the cavity.,8
189,"At about 1 ns, we see that the K ion, which was located close to the gate, has moved up toward the top of the cavity (Fig. 7b), and this leads to an increase in the number of HO molecules (38 instead of 32).",5
190,"This value then fluctuates between 32 and 38, depending on the position of K in the cavity.",8
191,Some examples of the behavior of the center of mass of some water molecules . simulation time in the open state are illustrated in Fig. 10.,8
192,The first example concerns a water molecule which remains inside the cavity during the simulation time.,8
193,"In the second example, the molecule initially located in the gate region enters the cavity after 0.4 ns and remains confined inside.",8
194,The third example corresponds to a molecule which exits the cavity after an initial ≈0.4 ns stay at its lower limit toward the intracellular medium.,8
195,"In the last example, the water molecule inside the cavity leaves.",8
196,"A striking behavior can be observed for all the water molecules which migrate in or outside the cavity: there is a transit residence time varying between 0.2 and 0.4 ns,  a plateau for . time when entering or exiting the cavity, near its lower limit.",5
197,"Let us mention that in the open relaxed state, among the 40 water molecules located in the filter + cavity + reservoir (on each side of KcsA), only 28 are conserved over the 1.5 ns simulation time, while 12 water molecules have been replaced by others initially located in the intracellular region.",5
198,This remark shows the great mobility of water in the open pore.,4
199,"Finally, it is also interesting to correlate the motions of the water molecules inside the cavity with those of K ion.",9
200,The distance between the centers of mass of the two species has been studied for most of the water molecules.,9
201,In Fig. 11 we illustrate the behavior of this distance with time for one water molecule.,8
202,The minimum distance  ≈ 2.8 Å corresponds to the radius of the first sphere of solvation for the K ion (mean distance between the centers of mass of K and oxygen atoms).,8
203,"We see that the water molecule spends a rather long time in this sphere, but it can also rapidly move far away from the ion, to distances that can reach 8–12 Å.",5
204,Such values for this mutual distance correspond to opposite locations in the cavity for the two species K and HO.,5
205,"This feature is reproduced for most of the other water molecules in the cavity (not shown), indicating that solvation is a very dynamical process,  there are permanent exchanges of water molecules in the solvation spheres.",4
206,We have shown that MD simulations complemented by arguments based on an electrostatic description of the protein can help to deepen our understanding of the role played by water molecules confined in the filter and the cavity of a KcsA pore.,4
207,"With regard to the formation of the K ion sites and the dynamics of the ions, interesting features have also been obtained by comparing the behavior of water in the closed and open conformations of the pore.",4
208,"First, we demonstrated that water in the filter reinforces the potential wells’ signature of the K sites in the sequence KWKWK…K.",4
209,"Second, we observed that the water dipole orientations in the cavity are strongly correlated with the motions of the K ion.",4
210,"This correlation nevertheless does not prevent water molecules from entering or exiting the cavity when the protein conformation changes (through opening or relaxation of the M helices at the gate), and water diffusion proceeds by always keeping an optimal shell of oxygen atoms around the K ions.",4
211,"A yet deeper insight to describe in a more explicit way the interactions between water, protein and K ions could be provided (i) by the use of  calculations and (ii) by considering the water diffusion over much longer times, which would require other numerical methods than MD, and would also allow the study of the variation of the number of water molecules in the cavity during the closing process.",4
0,Electrochemical transport properties of a cone-shaped nanopore: revisited,9
1,There are reports in the literature that a single cone-shaped nanopore generated in a polymer foil separating two equally concentrated dilute aqueous potassium chloride solutions can reach high and low stationary electrical conductivity states respectively depending on the sign of the applied electrical potential.,1
2,"On the basis of published data it has been argued (D. Woermann, , 2003, , 1853) that this phenomenon can be understood in terms of a well established model describing the electrochemical transport properties of polyelectrolyte membranes (“model of the membrane with narrow pores”).",1
3,In the present contribution experimental evidence is presented which gives strong support to these arguments using a model system.,0
4,Based on the “model of the membrane with narrow pores” a composite membrane is constructed mimicking the structure and electrochemical function of an ensemble of conical nanopores.,3
5,It is found that the characteristic electrochemical transport property of the composite membrane is that of a cone-shaped nanopore.,4
6,In recent publications observations of a non-ohmic (diode-like) current voltage characteristic of membranes carrying a single cone-shaped nanopore in contact with equally concentrated dilute aqueous potassium chloride solutions have been reported.,1
7,The nanopore is produced by an advanced track etch technique.,1
8,"The following values characterizing the pore geometry are given in the literature: length of the pore,  ≈ 10 μm; diameter of the base of the conical pore, 2≈500 nm; tip of the conical pore 2 ≈ 2 nm–10 nm.",1
9,It has to be kept in mind that the diameter of the tip of the cone-shaped pore is not well defined.,1
10,It cannot be smaller than the diameter of the latent ion track in the membrane matrix.,1
11,For polymeric organic materials an estimated value of the diameter of a latent ion track of about 10 nm is given.,1
12,In  the transport properties of single cone-shaped pores described in the literature are compared with predictions of the “model of the membrane with narrow pores”.,1
13,It is concluded that these properties can be rationalised on the basis of this model.,1
14,The arguments in  and  are based on three assumptions: (a) The internal surface of a cone-shaped pore carries negative charged groups (–COO groups) which are generated by the etching process.,1
15,"The fixed charges are compensated by mobile counterions ( K, Na ions) (b) In the  of the cone-shaped pore there exists a homogeneous positive electrical charge density  which is formed by the thermal motion of the mobile counterions ( = −;  = −( − ): , Faraday number; , sign of the fixed charges, here  = −1; , fixed ion concentration in the tip region ([mol cm]); (), concentration of mobile on species  in the tip region).",1
16,The concentrations of the mobile ions in the tip region determine the electrical conductivity of the pore fluid in that region.,1
17,It is independent of the direction of the electrical current flow across the tip region.,1
18,(c) In the  of the cone-shaped pore the positive space charge density does not extend into the lumen of the wide region.,1
19,It is limited to a narrow region near the internal pore wall.,1
20,The state of the pore fluid away from the region close to the pore wall is not influenced by the presence of the positive space charge.,1
21,Under electrical current flow across the pore the stationary electrical conductivity of the pore fluid (and the stationary the electrolyte concentration) in the wide region of the cone-shaped pore will depend on the direction of the flow of electrical current.,1
22,"This is caused by the fact that value of electrical transference number  of the counterions in the tip region is larger than the corresponding transference number  in the wide region of the pore (/ ≪1, ≈ 1;  ≈ 0.5; free solution; , electrolyte concentration in the bulk phase of the composite membrane).",1
23,In this contribution results of experiments are reported which are carried out with a composite track etched membrane mimicking the structure and function of a conical pore.,3
24,The composite consists of two membranes carrying straight track-etched pores with the same pore diameter ( ≈100 nm) arranged in series (see insert in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).,3
25,The track-etched pores of the ( = −1)-membrane (membrane m) are filled with a polyelectrolyte gel carrying negatively charged fixed ionic groups (- SOgroups).,3
26,This membrane is assumed to model the electrochemical transport properties of tip region of a cone-shaped pore.,3
27,The pores of the ( = 0)-membrane (membrane m) are not treated.,3
28,That membrane is assumed to model the electrochemical transport properties of the wide region of a cone-shaped pore.,3
29,The influence of the fixed -COO charges at the internal surface of the wide pores of membrane m on the state of the pore fluid is neglected.,3
30,The matrix of the membranes used in this study consists of a poly(ethylene terephthathalate) foil (abbreviated PET) with a thickness of about  ≈ 10μm.,10
31,Track etched membranes with straight pores are produced from this foil.,10
32,"Three sets of membranes with different pore diameters are used (effective pore diameters: 50 nm, 100nm, and 200 nm; pore density  ≈ (2.5 ± 0.5) × 10 cm).",10
33,Several membranes are cut from stocks of irradiated and etched PET foils.,10
34,"The stocks (charge number, 586) have been produced by Apel (Felerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, JINR, 141980, Russia).",10
35,Both sides of several track membranes with the same pore diameter are treated with a solution of perfluorinated ion exchange powder Nafion (5 wt.% in a isopropanol/water mixture; Sigma Aldrich Com).,10
36,Nafion carries -SO groups and is insoluble in water.,10
37,This treatment has the purpose to fill the pores of the membrane with a gel carrying negatively charged ionic groups.,10
38,"The success of this treatment is checked by measuring the electrical potential difference Δ (=′ −  ″) across a treated membrane [( = −1- membrane] separating two bulk phases formed by two aqueous NaCl solutions of different compositions using two identical Ag/AgCl /KCl (aq)// electrodes with NaCl salt bridges ((′), left bulk phase; (″), right bulk phase).",10
39,The NaCl concentration ′s in the left bulk phase is lower by a factor of 10 than the corresponding NaCl concentration ″s in the right bulk phase.,10
40,The mean electrolyte concentration of the solution 〈〉 is small compared with the estimated fixed ion concentration X in the NAFION gel plugging up the pores of the track etched membrane gel.,10
41,Values of Δ in the range 45 mV<Δ<52 mV are found (′s = 5 × 10; ″s = 5 × 10;  = 1 mol dm).,8
42,"This indicates that from an electrochemical point of view the track etched ( = −1)-membranes have the properties of a cation ion exchange membrane predominantly permeable to counterions (Na ions)(Δ = (2.303/)log(″s/′s); ( ≈ 300 K; , universal gas constant; , Faraday number; , thermodynamic temperature; ″s/′s = 10; Δ ≈ +58 mV).",5
43,Under electrical current flow the fraction  ( = /) of the electrical current I carried by the Na ions across the ( = −1)-membrane is expected to be close to  ≈ 1.,6
44,Independent experiments show that the –Δ curve of the track-etched ( = −1)-membranes prepared in a manner just described are symmetric (linear) with respect to a change of the direction of an electrical current flow.,5
45,Corresponding measurements of the membrane potential Δ of untreated track etched ( = 0)-membranes show that the observed electrical potential differences Δ is small (Δ<5 mV).,8
46,It is identified with a diffusion potential.,5
47,It is concluded that the electrochemical state of the electrolyte solution filling the pores of the untreated membranes is not influence by the presence of the fixed -COO charges at the pore wall.,4
48,"Under electrical current flow the fraction of the electrical current  carried by the Na across ( = 0)-membranes is expected to be close to that in free solution (for ′s = ″s,  ≈ 0.5).",6
49,A composite track etched membrane is formed by placing an untreated ( = 0) -track etched membrane and a treated ( = −1)-track etched membrane wetted by distilled water with their flat sides on top of each other.,10
50,Care is taken to prevent air bubbles to be trapped between the surfaces of the two membranes.,10
51,"The composite membrane is placed between two equally concentrated and mechanically stirred NaCl solutions (′s = ″s = 5 × 10; Plexiglass cells with rubber gaskets; volume of each bulk phase, 160 cm; effective membrane area  = 2.5 cm).",10
52,Two titanium grid electrodes with a layer of platinum deposited onto the surface of the grid are immersed into the bulk phases.,10
53,These electrodes are used to apply an electrical current under galvanostatic conditions.,10
54,The total net amount of electrical charge transported across a membrane during the measurements of one stationary current- voltage curve is so small that a possible influence of pH changes in the bulk phases caused by the reactions at the electrodes on the electrochemical measurements can be neglected.,10
55,Two identical Ag/AgCl/KCl(aq)// electrodes in contact with Luggin capillaries filled with the solution contained in the bulk phase are used to measure the electrical potential difference across the membrane.,10
56,The tips of the two Luggin capillaries are positioned reproducibly opposite to each other at a fixed distance from the surface of the composite membrane.,10
57,A typically stationary –Δ curve of a composite membrane with a pore diameter of 100 nm is shown in Fig. 1.,8
58,The non-ohmic character of the –Δ curve is clearly visible.,5
59,The insert in Fig. 1 shows schematically the experimental set up.,10
60,It also shows schematically the corresponding orientation of a single cone-shaped pore for which a similarly shaped –Δ is found.,10
61,The shape of corresponding –Δ curves of composite track etched membranes with diameters of 50 nm and 200 nm is very similar to that of a composite membrane with a pore diameter of 100 nm.,5
62,These curves are not shown.,8
63,The stationary –Δ curve shown in Fig. 1 indicates that a composite tack-etched membrane reach high conductivity states when the electrical potential difference Δ (=(′ − ″)) across the membrane has negative values.,5
64,Positive charge carriers (Na ions) are transported from the right bulk phase into the left bulk phase.,5
65,In the pores of the ( = −1)-membrane the electrical current is transported predominantly by Na ions (/ ≪1;  ≫ ).,5
66,They are the counterions of the fixed charges of the polyelectrolyte gel filling the pores (( = −1)-membrane ≈ 1).,5
67,This leads to an increase of the concentration of NaCl in the pores of the ( = 0)-membrane.,5
68,Within the pores of the ( = 0)-membrane the electrical current is carried by Na ions as well as by Cl ions (( = 0)-membrane ≈ 0.5).,5
69,A stationary high conductivity state of the composite membrane is reached when the concentration profile of NaCl in the ( = 0)-membrane has reached a time independent value.,5
70,In this state the mean NaCl concentration in the pores of the ( = 0)-membrane is higher than the NaCl concentration in the bulk phases.,8
71,This is shown schematically in Fig. 2.,5
72,The composite membrane reaches a low conductivity state when the electrical potential difference Δ = (′ − ″) across the membrane has positive values and positive charge carries (Na ions) are transported from the left into the right bulk phase.,5
73,Since the value of transference number of the Naions within the ( = − 1)- membrane is higher than that within the ( = 0)-membrane the NaCl concentration in the pores of the ( = 0)-membrane decreases.,5
74,A stationary low conductivity state of the composite membrane is established when the concentration profile of NaCl in the ( = 0)-membrane has reached a time independent value.,8
75,In this state the mean NaCl concentration in the ( = 0)-membrane is lower than the NaCl concentration in the bulk phases (see Fig. 2).,8
76,"In summary, the transition from a high conductivity state to a low conductivity state is caused mainly by changes of the mean electrolyte concentration and consequently by the electrical conductivity in the pores of the ( = 0)-membrane.",4
77,The ( = 0)-membrane and the ( = −1)-membrane are not bound together permanently but are separated by a thin film of an aqueous solution.,3
78,"Furthermore, most pores of he composite membrane do not run across both membranes uninterruptedly.",3
79,These complications can be taken into account by assigning an effective thickness to the ( = 0)-membrane which is larger than its geometrical thickness.,3
80,This does not influence the interpretation the stationary –Δ curve just described.,3
81,"Under electrical current flow an electroosmotic volume flow  across the ( = −1)-membrane could take place (Δ > 0,  directed from left to right; (Δ < 0,  directed from right to left).",3
82,This would not change the interpretation given because stationary –Δ values are considered.,3
83,Under electrical current flow a change of concentration of NaCl will occur in the region to the right of the phase boundary ( = − 1)-membrane/ bulk phase (″) at the mouth of the pores filled with the polyelectrolyte gel plugs.,3
84,This concentration change is caused by the change of the electrical transference number of the Na ions at this phase boundary.,3
85,It is argued that the influence of this concentration polarisation on the shape of the I-Δ curve can be expected to be small.,6
86,The solid angle for the transport of NaCl toward the mouths of the pores at Δ < 0 and away from the mouths of the pores for Δ > 0 is large compared with the corresponding solid angle within the ( = −1)-membrane.,6
87,This minimises the possible influence of a concentration polarisation at the interface ( = −1)-membrane/ bulk phase (″).,6
88,It has been argued in  that the wide region and the tip region of a single cone-shaped nanopore have different electrochemical transport properties and that the combination of both properties generate the typical non-ohmic electrical current/voltage characteristic of a pore.,1
89,It has been argued further that the “model of the membrane with narrow pores” can be used to describe thee transport properties of the two regions.,1
90,To test this concept experimentally a composite membrane with two membranes (m and m) arranged in series is constructed.,0
91,Membrane m is prepared to have the electrochemical properties of the wide region of the cone-shaped pore.,3
92,Membrane m is prepared to have the electrochemical properties of the wide region of the cone-shaped pore.,3
93,When the composite membrane separates two equally concentrated dilute aqueous potassium chloride solutions it reaches high and low stationary electrical conductivity states respectively depending on the sign of the electrical potential difference applied across the composite membrane.,5
94,"This experimental finding strongly supports the arguments presented in  and : In deed, the electrochemical transport properties of a cone-shaped nanopore reported in  can be explained on the basis of the “model of the membrane with narrow pores”.",4
0,"Ground state and electronic spectrum of Cu(ii) and Cu(iii) complexes of ,′-1,2-phenylenebis-2-mercaptoacetamide",9
1,"The electronic structure and the UV-vis spectrum of reduced and oxidized model systems of the ,′-1,2-phenylenebis(2-mercapto-2-methylpropionamide) copper complex have been studied using a multiconfigurational quantum chemical method (CASSCF/CASPT2).",9
2,The bonds between Cu and the two sulfur ligand atoms have a large covalent character in the oxidized Cu(iii) form.,5
3,"As a result of the increased covalency, the effective charge on the Cu atom is actually smaller in the oxidized form.",5
4,The electronic spectrum for both oxidation states of the complex is in agreement with the experiment for excitation energies and intensities showing that the theoretical description of the electronic structure is essentially correct.,4
5,All bands that involve excitations from either Cu or S localized orbitals to the empty or half empty CuS antibonding orbital have been characterized.,5
6,"The ,′-1,2-phenylenebis(2-mercapto-2-methylpropionamide) complexes of Cu(ii) and Cu(iii) (Cuphmi), containing the NS chelating group in a square-planar coordination environment, are interesting models of copper proteins.",1
7,"For example, the high affinity for copper and the NS coordination environment are peculiar properties of the active site of methanobactin, a copper acquisition protein.",1
8,Hanss and Krüger obtained the X-ray crystal structure of both the oxidized and reduced forms of Cuphmi and also measured the electronic spectrum in acetonitrile solution.,1
9,The X-ray absorption (XAS) spectra of Cu(iii)phmi and Cu(ii)phmi in solid phase have recently been recorded and analyzed.,1
10,"The structures of the Cu(ii) and Cu(iii) ionic complexes were obtained using the B3LYP density functional method, with a 6-31G(d,p) basis set, considering different possible spin multiplicities.",1
11,"The shape of the experimental XAS K-edge region was rationalized in the frame of an orbital approximation, employing HF molecular orbital eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the optimized DFT structures.",1
12,The singlet state of the Cu(iii) complex was shown to be more stable than the triplet state in agreement with the absence of an experimental ESR signal for the oxidized complex.,1
13,A XAS study on similar Cu(ii) and Cu(iii) complexes showed that the shape of the corresponding K-edge region depends on the electronic properties and the coordination geometry of the chelating ligand.,1
14,"Moreover, a shift of about 2 eV was observed in the assigned resonances when going from Cu(ii) to Cu(iii) ions.",1
15,"A Cu(iii) complex with six coordinated sulfur atoms in an octahedral geometry has been characterized, confirming a d electron configuration of Cu(iii) with a triplet spin state, in contrast to the situation in Cu(iii)phmi.",1
16,"In order to gain a better understanding of the electronic properties of these interesting molecules, we present here results from a theoretical study of the electronic structure of Cu(iii)phmi and Cu(ii)phmi models in the ground and lower excited states originating from excitations within the 3d shell or from the sulfur lone pair orbitals to the empty (or half empty) 3d orbital.",0
17,The information obtained can be used to obtain a better understanding of the nature of the XAS K-edge resonances and the present study will be extended to an explicit calculation of the XAS resonances in a forthcoming publication.,1
18,Wave functions and energies have been generated using the complete active space (CAS) SCF method with dynamic correlation added using second order perturbation theory (CASPT2).,3
19,"It has been shown recently in a series of papers that this approach, which includes scalar relativistic effects, is to date among the most accurate methodologies that can be used to obtain detailed information on the electronic structure of the ground and low-lying excited states of transition metal complexes.",3
20,The same approach has been used previously to study the electronic spectrum of a number of blue copper proteins where one of the ligands is cysteine.,1
21,That comprehensive investigation resulted in a paradigm shift for the explanation of the origin of the specific structural characteristics of the blue copper proteins.,1
22,The earlier ideas were based on the assumption of a strained protein structure that forced the specific (tetrahedral) structure of the active Cu(ii) site.,1
23,It was shown in the theoretical work that it is the special nature of the copper sulfur bond that favors a tetrahedral structure instead of the normal tetragonal arrangement of the ligand.,1
24,It is known that the copper sulfur bond is strong and has a dominating covalent character with the bonding and antibonding orbitals delocalized over both centers.,1
25,"As a result, the metal–ligand bonding in blue copper proteins can occur either through the sulphur σ lone pair orbital, yielding a tetragonal coordination site, or through the sulphur π lone pair orbital, in this case stabilizing a tetrahedral active center.",1
26,"The most prominent spectral features arise from excitations to the half-filled (Cu(ii)) or empty (Cu(iii)) antibonding Cu–S orbital from either the 3d-orbitals, from the sulfur lone pair orbitals, or from the bonding Cu–S orbital.",1
27,The latter transition is supposed to give rise to the strongest band in the low energy part of the electronic spectrum.,1
28,It is traditional to classify these transitions as either d–d or ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT).,1
29,"However, considering the delocalized nature of the antibonding Cu–S orbital, this picture is not accurate.",1
30,"All these transitions contain some charge transfer character, which is special for the thiolate ligand.",1
31,We shall return to this point in the analysis of the excited states.,1
32,"Two sets of calculations were performed at CASPT2 level on the structure of the copper model complexes with the ligand ,′-1,2-phenylenebis-2-mercaptoacetamide, which we call Cuphma: one using the averaged  geometry obtained from the X-ray structure of the Cuphmi complexes and one using the fully optimized geometry of Cuphmi calculated at unrestricted B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) DFT level.",6
33,"The singlet and the triplet states of Cu(iii)phmi and the doublet state of Cu(ii)phmi were considered, by imposing the  symmetry (see Table 1).",6
34,"The reason of this choice is that the important Cu–S bond distance is quite different in the two cases, as can be seen in Table 1, while the transition energies strongly depend on this distance, because the energy separation between the bonding and antibonding Cu–S orbitals is strongly linked to it.",6
35,We have shown that DFT gives a Cu–S bond which is too long by about 0.08 Å in the active site of plastocyanin.,1
36,"In the present case, it becomes more difficult to optimize this bond distance using the CASPT2 method, due to the strong coupling to other bonds in the chelating ligand system.",3
37,"On the other hand, the experimental geometry of the small title complexes can be expected to be accurate in contrast to the case of a protein.",7
38,"For the same reason, the DFT optimized geometry of Cuphma (see Table 1) was not used in the CASPT2 calculations.",3
39,In Cuphma the methyl groups on the atom C are replaced by hydrogen atoms (. Fig. 1).,3
40,Such a simplification only influences excited states to a small extent originating from excitations in the active site region.,3
41,"While the calculations have been performed on the isolated Cu(iii)phma and Cu(ii)phma ions, the experimental spectrum of Cuphmi was measured in acetonitrile solution.",1
42,"Clearly, the transition energies are shifted by the solvent.",1
43,"A rough estimate could be obtained from the relative dipole moments in the ground and excited states, but it is also known that acetonitrile molecules are very weakly coordinated to the axial sites of the square planar copper environment.",1
44,One of the crucial steps in the calculation is the choice of the active orbitals.,6
45,"We are interested in transitions occurring in the active site, that is, within the metal 3d-orbitals and from the sulfur 3p-orbitals to the metal.",6
46,So we need to consider the five 3d- and four S3p-orbitals with 17 (16 for Cu(iii)) active electrons.,6
47,"We also need to account for the strong radial correlation effects in the localized 3d-orbitals by adding a second set of orbitals, 3d′ (the so called  effect.)",6
48,These extra active orbitals are particularly important for excitations where the number of d electrons change.,6
49,"Here we need four such orbitals, which yields a total active space of 13 orbitals divided in 5, 2, 3, 3, respectively in the four representations of the  point group, a, b, b, a.",6
50,Basis sets of the Atomic Natural Orbital (ANO) type were used for all atoms.,6
51,"Such basis sets have newly been developed that include scalar relativistic effects and correlation of the semi-core electrons, for example the 3p electrons on the Cu atom.",6
52,"The size of the basis sets were: Cu: 6s5p3d2f, S: 5s4p2d, C,N,O: 4s3p1d, and H: 2s1p.",6
53,The selected basis sets contain enough diffuse functions to ensure a good quality in the calculation of the oscillator strengths.,6
54,These have been computed at CASSCF level of theory.,6
55,All calculations have been performed with the MOLCAS-6.0 quantum chemistry software.,10
56,We first give an overall description of the electronic structure of the region around the metal atom.,9
57,"In Table 1 it is seen that the Cu–S distance in the optimized geometry of Cuphmi is larger than the one observed experimentally, of about 0.03 and 0.05 Å for oxidized and reduced forms, respectively.",8
58,This distance further increases by 0.04 and 0.08 Å in the optimized geometry of Cuphma.,8
59,"While the first structural distortion could be associated both to solid state packing effects and to the tendency of DFT methods in predicting larger bond lengths, the one observed in Cuphma is to be attributable also to the simplification of the ligand model.",4
60,For this reason we have performed our calculations using the coordinates of Cuphmi.,10
61,The characteristic features of the Cu–S bonding and antibonding (CuS*) orbitals are presented in Fig. 2.,8
62,This figure shows the orbital pair for both Cu(ii)phma and Cu(iii)phma.,8
63,In the oxidized form we would expect to find a stronger covalent character of the bond and this is also what the figure illustrates.,7
64,"Actually, we have an almost equal distribution of the electron pair over all three centers in the bonding orbital.",8
65,The orbital has b symmetry and thus combines the antisymmetric in plane sulfur lone-pair orbital with the metal 3d orbital to form the three center bond.,5
66,The symmetric lone-pair combination (of a symmetry) does not interact strongly with the metal center and remains localized on the sulfur atoms.,5
67,The b orbital is doubly occupied in both complex ions.,8
68,The antibonding orbital is singly occupied in the reduced form.,8
69,"In the oxidized form we find 0.14 electrons in this orbital, showing that there is a strong static correlation effect in the Cu–S bond, which is typical for weak covalent bonds.",4
70,It is obvious from the electronic structure that the ground state of the oxidized form of the complex should be a singlet state.,5
71,"In fact, the reduced form has the odd electron in the CuS* orbital and can be easily removed.",5
72,The presence of an electron in an antibonding orbital explains the longer CuS bond distance in Cu(ii)phmi compared to that observed in Cu(iii)phmi (see Table 1).,5
73,"We have computed the energy difference between the lowest singlet, A, and triplet, A, states of Cu(iii)phma and found it to be close to 25 000 cm (3.09 eV), thus showing that the ground state is a singlet.",5
74,The spin–density in Cu(ii)phma is almost entirely localized on the copper ion (92%) with most of the remaining density actually located on the nitrogen atoms of the ligand.,8
75,"The localization of the spin is achieved by mixing two configurations, one dominating (weight 83%) with the spin in the antibonding orbital and one (weight 13%) with the spin in the bonding orbital.",5
76,"The wave function in the ground state of Cu(iii)phma is dominated by two single closed shell configurations, one with the bonding Cu–S orbital occupied (weight 91%) and one doubly excited configuration where the corresponding antibonding orbital is doubly occupied (weight 6%).",8
77,"This is typical for the formation of a comparably weak covalent bond, in this case between the 3d Cu orbital and the antisymmetric combination of the in-plane sulfur lone pair orbitals (see Fig. 2).",4
78,The electronic spectrum of Cu(ii)phma is characterized in the low energy region by excitations into the half empty CuS* orbital (lower right orbital in Fig. 2) from the filled 3d shells and from the sulfur 3p lone pair orbitals.,8
79,Computed energies are shown in Table 2.,8
80,The four first excited states correspond to the ligand field transitions resulting in a hole in one of the four localized 3d orbitals.,5
81,The two transitions with the largest oscillator strengths can be assigned to the first two bands found in the experimental spectrum.,5
82,Then three transitions follow that are characterized as LMCT from the sulfur lone pair orbitals to the CuS* orbital.,5
83,Two of them have appreciable intensity.,5
84,The most intense band (with a peak at 32 258 cm) corresponds to excitation from the symmetric in-plane sulfur 3p orbital.,5
85,"As expected, we find this transition at a lower energy than the one coming from the antisymmetric 3p combination, which is stabilized by the interaction with the Cu 3d orbital.",5
86,"The agreement with the four bands found in the experimental spectrum is satisfactory, but we would like to point out that the transition energies depend strongly on the geometry used.",4
87,The total energy for the ground state (CASSCF and CASPT2) is 1.4 eV lower for the DFT optimized structure than for the structure obtained from the X-ray measurements.,5
88,This might indicate that the crystal structure is perturbed by the packing in the crystal.,4
89,"The experimental spectrum was measured in acetonitrile, so one can also expect some solvent shifts, in particular for charge transfer excitations.",4
90,"The changes in dipole moments are small for the ligand field excitations.The ground state dipole moment is −7.41 D, the four first excited states have dipole moments between −6.52 and −7.41 D, and the following three (LMCT) states have dipole moments in the range −11.93 to −12.13 D. Thus, we can see a clear difference between the ligand field states and the charge transfer states and we can expect a bathochromic shift of the transition energies for the latter transition energies.",4
91,"The clear distinction between ligand field and LMCT states is also illustrated by the Mulliken charges on the copper ion (. Table 2), which is around 0.8 for the ligand field states and close to zero for the LMCT states, while the ground state charge is +0.7.",5
92,The odd electron is removed from the CuS* orbital in the oxidized form.,6
93,"Thus, this orbital is now empty.",6
94,All low lying excited states correspond to transitions of an electron into this orbital.,6
95,The computed excitation energies and oscillator strengths are presented in Table 3.,8
96,The agreement with the three experimental bands in the low energy region is fair.,8
97,"Again we see that computed excitation energies depend on the geometry used, but, analogously to the reduced complex, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusion about the preferred geometry.",8
98,"In fact, the total energy of the DFT optimized geometry is 1.1 eV lower than the one calculated for the experimental structure.",8
99,The transition at 24 000 cm is intense with an oscillator strength of 0.28.,8
100,"Although it is a transition from a 3d orbital to CuS*, there is a reorganization effect in the excited state that diminishes the amount of charge transfer.",5
101,The created open shell interacts with the sulfur lone pair orbitals such that the orbital is delocalized.,5
102,Thus charge is back donated into the 3d shell from the sulfur orbitals.,5
103,Such interaction was not present in the reduced complex.,5
104,"It can occur easier here because of the shorter Cu–S bond distance, that decreases up to 0.13 Å for the optimized geometry of the oxidized form of Cuphma.",4
105,The stronger back donation effect also results in larger and more irregular variations of the dipole moments for the different states.,4
106,"The ground state moment is −2.28 D, while the moments for the excited states vary between −5.21 and +9.30 D. The back donation effect is nicely illustrated by the Mulliken charges on copper, as shown in Table 3.",5
107,"The ground state charge is +0.39, which is smaller than the copper charge observed in the reduced form!",5
108,"Moreover, it does not deviate much from this value in the excited states.",8
109,"The charge neutralization effect is a result of the strong covalency in the Cu–S bond and it is much more effective here than it is in Cu(ii)phma, where the interaction of copper with the sulfur atoms is weaker.",4
110,"We have in this report described the electronic structure and spectrum of the reduced and oxidized forms of a copper model complex of ,′-1,2-phenylenebis(2-mercapto-2-methylpropionamide), with the four methyl groups on the atom C replaced by hydrogens.",4
111,"The system is interesting because of the two Cu–S bonds, which do not behave as normal dative bonds, but more like covalent bonds.",5
112,This is most pronounced in the oxidized form.,8
113,"As a result of the increased covalency, the effective charge on the Cu atom is actually smaller in the oxidized form.",5
114,The correctness of the calculated electronic structure is validated through the calculation of the electronic spectrum for both oxidation states of the complex.,4
115,All bands that involve excitations from either Cu or S localized orbitals to the empty or half empty Cu–S* orbital have been characterized in terms of ligand field transitions and LMCT states involving sulfur orbitals.,4
116,These results provide support for the Cu–S* orbital also being involved in the core excitations observed by XAS.,4
117,The agreement with the experimental excitation energies and intensities shows that the theoretical description of the electronic structure is essentially correct.,4
0,Density functional studies of the luminescence of SiH,9
1,The molecular structures of the ground and the lowest excited state of a SiH cluster have been optimized at the density-functional-theory (DFT) level using the time-dependent perturbation-theory (TDDFT) approach for the excited state.,5
2,The electronic absorption and emission energies for the fully optimized molecular structures have been calculated at the TDDFT level.,5
3,The excitation energy calculated for the equilibrium structure of the excited state using the Becke–Perdew (BP) functional was found to be 0.72 eV smaller than the vertical excitation energy for the ground-state structure.,5
4,The calculated wavelength of the emitted light is 396 nm which agrees well with experiment as the silicon cluster emits blue light.,5
5,Small structural changes caused by the relaxation of the excited state introduce strains in the ground-state structure.,5
6,The strain and the relaxation are found to contribute equally to the large red shift of the emitted light.,5
7,"Thus, the present calculations do not support the notion that the potential-energy surface of the excited state has a double-well structure.",4
8,A more detailed understanding of light absorption and light emission processes requires information about the potential-energy surfaces of both the ground and the involved excited states.,2
9,"At absorption, the molecular system is excited from the ground state in its equilibrium geometry to an excited state and during the excitation process the molecular structure is approximately unchanged; the excitation is usually thought to be vertical.",1
10,"However, the ground-state structure is not necessarily optimal for the excited state resulting in a relaxation of the molecular structure of the excited state.",1
11,The deexcitation giving rise to the luminescence can probably be considered to occur vertically from the relaxed excited state structure.,1
12,This simplified absorption-emission mechanism suggests that the emitted light is red shifted as compared to the absorbed one.,1
13,"In photophysical studies of ultrasmall nano-sized Si particles, Nayfeh . found that the absorption occurs in the ultra-violet (UV) region, whereas the excited Si particles emitted blue light with such a high intensity that one was able to observe the individual particles.",1
14,Experimental and computational studies suggested that the Si nanoparticles most likely consist of 29 Si atoms which is a magic number for approximately spherically shaped clusters of  symmetry.,1
15,Spectroscopic studies showed that the Si cluster is covered by hydrogens.,1
16,"Si particles with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen termination have also been prepared and studied computationally.",1
17,The electronic absorption spectrum up to the ionization threshold has recently been calculated for the Si cluster at density-functional-theory (DFT) levels and the accuracy of the obtained excitation energies were checked using coupled-cluster response-theory (CC2) calculations.,1
18,"At the DFT level using the Becke–Perdew (BP) functional, the excitation energy of the first excited state is 3.85 eV which agrees well with the experimental excitation threshold of 3.7 eV.",1
19,"Calculations at the CC2 level and DFT calculations using a hybrid functional yielded somewhat larger excitation energies, whereas calculations at the coupled-cluster singles (CCS) and the closely related configuration-interaction singles (CIS) levels yielded an excitation threshold of about 6 eV.",1
20,The calculations also showed that the silicon cluster of 1 nm size possesses a band structure consisting of more than one hundred excited states below the ionization threshold at about 8 eV.,1
21,"Experimentally, the excited Si cluster is found to emit blue light which corresponds to an excitation energy of about 3 eV.",1
22,"Thus, the relaxation of the excited state leads to a huge shift of about 0.7 eV.",1
23,The large red shift of the luminescence has been explained by localized surface states in the Si nanocluster.,1
24,"Based on empirical tight-binding and first-principle local-density calculations, Allan . proposed that such states exist under the form of self-trapped excitons at the Si–Si dimers on the nanocluster surface.",1
25,Nayfeh . adopted their notion and examined various photoexcitation pathways involved in accessing and populating these molecular states.,1
26,"They found that the ground state has an all-confining single well, whereas the excited state has a double-well potential.",1
27,"The inner minimum corresponds to a normal nonradiative delocalized excited state with a Si–Si distance of the surface dimer of 2.35 Å, while the outer minimum corresponds to a radiative and trapped excitonic surface state with a Si–Si interspacing of 3.85 Å.",1
28,"In this work, the molecular structure of the first excited state of the SiH cluster has been fully optimized at the time-dependent density-functional-theory (TDDFT) level.",0
29,The corresponding emission spectrum as well as the absorption spectrum for the ground-state structure have been studied by employing TDDFT calculations.,9
30,The potential-energy curve for a relaxation pathway of the first excited state of the SiH cluster has also been investigated.,9
31,The molecular structure of the SiH cluster was optimized in the ground and the first excited state using the Turbomole program.,10
32,Structure optimizations were performed at the density-functional-theory (DFT) level using a gradient-corrected local-density approximation (BP) and triple-zeta valence quality basis sets augmented with polarization functions (TZVP).,10
33,Previous calculations showed that at least TZVP basis sets have to be used in order to obtain an accurate excitation spectrum.,1
34,The absorption and emission spectra were calculated using the time-dependent perturbation-theory approach (TDDFT).,10
35,The molecular structure of the first excited state was fully optimized at the BP TDDFT level using the Egrad module of Turbomole.,10
36,"The molecular structure of the ground state of the SiH cluster belongs to the  point group, whereas the symmetry of the first excited state was found to be .",8
37,"The molecular structure of the SiH cluster is shown in Fig. 1, and the bond lengths of the ground and excited states are given in Table I. Structure changes (Δ) due to the relaxation of the excited state are also given in the table.",8
38,"When the molecular structure of the Si cluster in the first excited state is assumed to belong to the  point group, the luminescence energy is red shifted by 0.26 eV as compared to the absorption threshold, while when the cluster is allowed to relax to a  structure, the energy decreases by 0.72 eV yielding a deexcitation energy of 3.14 eV.",8
39,"Thus, the wavelength of the emitted light is 396 nm; blue light is emitted as also detected experimentally.",5
40,"In Table I, one can see that the changes in the bond lengths are rather small.",5
41,The largest difference of 2.1 pm is obtained for the Si(2)–Si(4) bond.,8
42,"Si(2) is attached to Si(1), which is the central Si atom, and to Si(4) which is a surface Si atom with only one attached hydrogen.",8
43,See Fig. 1 for the atom numbering.,8
44,"The bonds to the central Si(1) become 1.1 pm longer than for the ground state, while when the  symmetry is enforced on the excited state, the Si(1)–Si(2) bond becomes 3.3 pm longer than for the ground state.",8
45,The changes in the bond lengths are remarkably small especially when one considers that the difference between the absorption and emission energies is as large as 0.72 eV.,5
46,The calculations show that there are two equal sources to the huge red shift: the relaxation of the excited state and the energy shift due to the strain of the ground state.,5
47,"In Table 2, the excitation energies of the first few dipole-allowed excitations are given.",8
48,"In the first three columns, the excitation energy and oscillator strengths obtained using the  structure of the ground state are given, while the remaining columns contain the corresponding data obtained using the optimized  structure of the first excited state.",8
49,The absorption and emission spectra obtained using the data of Table 2 are displayed in Fig. 2.,8
50,"As the emission spectrum is also constructed from calculated excitation energies and oscillator strengths, not all contributions to the emission are taken into account.",3
51,"For the luminescence spectrum, the molecular structure of the 1b state has been assumed.",3
52,Population of higher excited states leads to other molecular structures and different luminescence spectra.,3
53,"By optimizing the doubly degenerate 1e state one obtains a higher luminescence energy of about 3.5 eV, whereas for symmetry reasons, the three individual components of the 1t state are identical.",5
54,The relaxation pathway between the molecular structures of the ground and first excited states is difficult to compute.,3
55,"However, as a first guess one can assume that in the relaxation process the internal coordinates change linearly between the two extremes.",3
56,The excitation energy plot shown in Fig. 3 is obtained from such an interpolation procedure.,8
57,"As seen in the figure, the excitation energy is a smooth function decreasing from 3.85 eV for the ground-state structure and reaching 3.14 eV for the fully optimized structure of the excited state.",8
58,The potential-energy curves for the ground and excited states along the same trajectory are shown in Fig. 4.,8
59,The potential-energy curves for both states are smooth functions with one single minimum each.,8
60,"No avoiding crossing yielding double minima of the potential-energy surface of the excited state, as previously proposed, can be seen in the figure.",5
61,Fig. 4 shows that energy shift due to the relaxation of the excited state is equally significant to the red shift as the strain-energy contribution of the ground state.,4
62,The chosen trajectory is not necessarily the exact pathway of the relaxation process.,4
63,"However, the absence of a potential threshold along this trajectory for the excited state shows that the molecular structure of the excited state is, after excitation, relaxed without any barrier.",5
64,"In order to check whether the excited state has an outer potential minimum trapping an exciton state at the surface of the Si cluster, the optimization of the molecular structure of the first excited state was performed without any symmetry constraints  in  symmetry starting from a structure with a long Si(3)–Si(5) distance of 3.18 Å.",3
65,"However, no outer potential minimum could be found in the reoptimization of the first excited state.",8
66,"This, and the fact that the absorption and the emission energies are in close agreement with experimental data indicate that the potential-energy curve of the excited state does not possess any outer minimum.",5
67,The present calculations thus show that it is most unlikely that the potential-energy curve of the excited state has two minima separated by a barrier as previously suggested by Allan,4
68,"Instead, the small structural changes due to the relaxation of the excited state result in a lower energy for the excited state and simultaneously the energy of the ground state increases significantily due to the strain.",4
69,These two contributions seem to be equally responsible for the obtained luminescence shift of 0.72 eV.,4
0,Aromaticity on the edge of chaos: An  study of the bimodal balance between aromatic and non-aromatic structures for 10π-dihetero[8]annulenes,0
1,"The computed geometries of a class of 10π-annulenes containing two heteroatoms, which exhibit an acutely sensitive balance between π and σ influences upon ring planarity, reveal that the recent KMLYP hybridisation of the exchange functional in the DFT method is qualitatively superior to the more commonly used B3LYP hybrid for modelling the aromaticity of such systems.",4
2,"Aromaticity as a concept has been dominated for most of its history by the study of benzenoid systems containing single or fused six-membered rings, and the recognition in the 1920s that this motif was associated both with ring planarity and with an “aromatic sextet” of electrons.",1
3,"Dewar in 1945 was the first to recognise unambiguous aromatic character in a larger (seven-membered) ring, although the potential for aromaticity in the eight-membered ring cyclooctatetraene () had been considered much earlier, most revealingly by Penney in 1934 and Lennard-Jones in .1937",1
4,The latter was apparently the first to conclude from Hückel-like calculations that this 8π system would exhibit strong bond alternation and relatively little stabilisation as a planar species.,1
5,"Penney appears to have been the first to consider planar and buckled conformations, and his analysis of angular strain in the (CH) rings in particular is remarkably prescient of the theories of conformational analysis developed some 15 years later by Barton.",1
6,"By 1945 in a review of non-benzenoid aromatic hydrocarbons, Baker felt able to conclude that “it is doubtful if the instability of cyclooctatetraene can be explained on grounds of angular strain alone”, although it was not until 1965 that Breslow formalised this apparent instability with the term 4 “anti-aromatic”, invoking what had by then become known as the Hückel 4 + 2/4 rule of aromaticity.",1
7,We use term apparent instability because it has recently been argued in fact that such 4 “anti-aromatic” species are not destabilized electronically to any significant extent.,1
8,Angular ring strain is avoided in larger monocyclic rings which also follow the 4 + 2 rule such as [14] or [18] annulene  by including transoid motifs to retain planarity or methano bridges to avoid close non-bonded contacts.,1
9,The [9]annulene monoanion  with  symmetry appears to be the largest 10π annulene ring which is both planar and can accommodate all-cisoid motives.,1
10,"Somewhat surprisingly however, given the rather controversial origins surrounding the aromatic/non-aromatic/anti-aromatic character of the 4, less attention has been given to eight-membered rings involving instead 10 (and hence 4 + 2) rather than 8π electrons.",1
11,"Whilst the angular strain may be considered similar to that of , the presumption is that significantly more aromatic stabilisation will be present, hence tipping the balance towards planarity.",1
12,"The heterocyclic 10π 1,4-heteroannulenes  are one such a class for which a number of crystal structures have been reported.",1
13,"Remarkably, these exhibit wide variation in ring planarity and degree of bond alternation, in synchrony with the diatropic/non-diatropic NMR character of the molecules.",1
14,This suggests that the balance between planarising aromaticity and non-planarising angular strain in these systems is a fine one.,1
15,They may indeed be good examples of bimodal molecules where small changes to the substituents can invoke disproportionately large changes in their structure; a phenomenon which could be described as aromaticity on the edge of chaos.,1
16,"We considered that such bimodal molecules should serve as highly sensitive tests of modern quantitative electronic theories, since an accurate balance between ring strain, σ/π conjugation, bond delocalisation and associated electron correlation effects can often be a very difficult one to achieve in such theories.",7
17,"Here we report a consistent set of calculations on such systems at two levels of theory, the standard B3LYP/6-31G(d)  density functional procedure, and a newly reported rehybridisation known as KMLYP, in order to evaluate how sensitive the computed molecular geometries of such molecules are to variations in the computational method employed.",0
18,Calculations were performed using Gaussian 98 (Rev A11) using standard optimization methods on all the known examples of ring system – for which crystal structures have been reported.,6
19,"To invoke the KMLYP functional, the following Gaussian route commands were used: #iop(5/45 = 10000557) iop(5/46 = 00000443) #iop(5/47 = 04481000)For reference, some calculations were also performed at the (computationally very much more expensive) MP2 correlated level.",6
20,All final energies and geometries are available as electronic supplementary information (ESI).,8
21,Diatropic character was estimated using the NICS procedure as described by Schleyer and coworkers.,6
22,Schleyer and Wannere have recently suggested that the degree of bond length alternation in both [14] and [18] annulene () may be significantly greater than inferred from the hitherto accepted (1995) analysis of the X-ray structure.,1
23,"Noting that the commonly used B3LYP/6-31G(d)  density functional procedure associated little bond alternation with a poor prediction of the H NMR shifts of , they found that use of Kang and Musgrave's (KMLYP) rehybridisation of the density functional exchange terms predicted greater bond alternation but significantly also a much superior match between the computed H NMR shifts at this geometry and experiment.",1
24,"Following this suggestion, we considered it appropriate to also evaluate these two computational procedures for the bimodal series  to see if it represents an improved procedure for use when modelling molecules with aromatic properties.",0
25,"The crystal structure of 1,4-dioxocine , XYO, R6-(pyran-4-on-2-yl) exhibits a non planar geometry, with an 81° dihedral angle for C3–O4–C5–C6 and an approximate  axis passing through the mid points of C2–C3 and C6–C7.",1
26,"At the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level only one minimum corresponding to an almost planar structure could be located (Table 1); clearly this predicted geometry is qualitatively different from the crystal structure, and although crystal packing forces (no hydrogen bonding is possible) might explain the difference, there is little precedent for such large variation caused by this effect.",4
27,"In contrast, two minima were located at the KMLYP/6-31G(d) level; an essentially planar aromatic-like geometry equivalent to the B3LYP structure, and an apparent valence bond isomer (lower than the former by Δ 1.4 kcal mol following zero-point and entropy corrections) which matches the twisted crystal structure with a predicted C3–O4–C5–C6 angle of 78°.",5
28,"Similar results were obtained at the larger 6-311+G(3d,p) basis set level, indicating this result is not highly basis set dependent.",5
29,"The differing electronic nature of these two isomers is also reflected in the diatropic NMR character, as quantified using NICS values (Table 1); the planar B3LYP and KMLYP forms indicating moderate diatropicity, the twisted KMYLP form indicating a non-diatropic system comprising almost orthogonal p-p overlap at  O4–C5.",5
30,"Two valence bond isomers are also located at the MP2 correlated level, the non-planar being lower by 0.8 kcal mol.",8
31,"When the pyranonyl substituent is replaced by the modestly more electronegative chloroacetyl group, both B3LYP and KMLYP now concur, predicting the ring to be exactly  (at both the 6-31(d) and 6-311+G(3d,p) basis set levels) and in essential agreement with the crystal structure; the small experimental non-planarity (Table 1) may indeed now be due to crystal packing effects.",4
32,"No non-planar valence bond forms could be located at either level, although this does not preclude their existence as very shallow stationary points.",4
33,"Also of interest is the parent ring system (, XYO, RH).",9
34,"Only a single planar minimum is predicted at B3LYP and KMLYP levels, with the NICS values indicating modest diatropicity.",5
35,"MP2 optimisation results in location of two minima, the planar one being 2.6 kcal mol lower than the non-planar form.",8
36,"Experimentally, this system is reported as being planar in solution (from the J coupling constants), with H NMR shifts in a region (5.1–7.6 ppm) normally associated with diatropicity, but having a high olefin-like reactivity.",1
37,"It is possible that both planar and non-planar valence isomers are present as an equilibrium mixture in solution, thus imparting dual characteristics to this molecule.",7
38,"We therefore highlight this ring system as being close to a bimodal system on the edge of aromatic chaos, with relatively small changes to substituents apparently capable of invoking large changes in the geometry and aromaticity.",7
39,"Exact planarity from both (solid-state) experiment and calculation  a feature of the parent 1,4-dihydro-1,4-diazocine (, XYNH) and the 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl) derivative, but not so when the -substituent is an electron withdrawing ester group.",5
40,"Here again a significant difference between B3LYP and KMLYP is predicted, the latter appearing to be the more correct in terms of the computed bond lengths (no dihedral angles being reported for this system).",7
41,"The N-dimethylamide group is predicted as intermediate in planarity between -alkyl and -ester, although the X-ray structure is quoted as being planar.",7
42,This molecule may be particularly finely balanced between planar aromaticity and non-planar non-aromaticity and may again be a good example of a bipolar aromatic molecule.,7
43,", XYN-mesyl at the KMLYP level also shows subtle behaviour; a non-planar stationary point appears as a near inflexion point during geometry optimization, but the final geometry is almost planar; at the MP2 level the non planar form is a genuine minimum.",5
44,"Replacing a further ring carbon with a nitrogen heteroatom (, XYN–COMe), Table 1) induces non-planarity which is more unambiguously predicted.",5
45,"For the mixed heteroatom series, planarity is both observed and computed for XO, YN-3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl.",5
46,"With YN-Ts however, the crystal structure is described as “having considerable torsion”.",1
47,"Both MP2 and KMLYP optimizations result in location of such isomer (C3–O4–C5–C6 ≅93° and ≅82.5° respectively), although only with the former is the more stable the non-planar form ( the similar KMLYP behaviour for , XYN-Mesyl).",5
48,"The 1,4-dithiocine series (, XYS) are all non-planar and equally well predicted with B3LYP and KMLYP, as is the oxathiocine (, XO, YS).",5
49,"The series , XCH are all predicted planar and are known to be diatropic (Table 1).",5
50,"The (as yet unknown) parent system for , XO, YS, RH however shows another amplified difference between B3LYP and KMLYP.",5
51,"Valence bond isomers were located at both levels; for the former, the planar aromatic form was 3.0 kcal mol lower, with KMLYP the non-aromatic form was 0.7 kcal mol more stable.",5
52,"The existence of a locatable transition state between the two valence forms suggests these minima may not simply be artifacts of the single reference KMLYP (and MP2) procedures, but genuine (aromatic and non-aromatic) isomers straddling a Möbius-type transition state (C3–O4–C5–C6 ≅38°/KMLYP) which represents the  configuration for the 4 + 2 π electrons present.",4
53,The analogy would be to planar  being the least stable 4 electronic configuration between two non-planar non-aromatic minima and hence a transition state connecting them.,4
54,The seven-ring analogue  (XYZNH) is predicted both slightly non-planar  diatropic; the only two known crystal structures of this 10π ring system (XYZNR and XYZSe) likewise reveal non-planarity.,5
55,"Finally, we note that only known example of a 6π four membered ring system (, RCl, R′2,4,6-tri-t-butylphenyl) is also non-planar, but the origins of this are unlikely to be angular strain and are more likely associated either with poor pp overlaps or a high degree of electron repulsion in a small ring.",4
56,"We argue here that molecules such as – are good examples of bipolar systems on the chaotic edge of aromaticity, where small changes of substitution on either the ring or the heteroatom can induce large (but predictable) changes to both the degree of delocalisation of the double bonds, reflected in the corresponding planarity and hence aromaticity of the system.",4
57,"As such, they serve to provide challenging tests of modern quantitative electronic structure theories.",4
58,"Of these, we suggest that the KMLYP/6-31(d) method appears capable of predicting this sensitivity more reliably than the older B3LYP treatment.",4
59,We propose that synthesis and accurate structure determination of a more comprehensive set of substituted heteroaromatics such as  or  could serve as a novel type of reference library which could serve as the basis for developing even better hybridisations of density functional and other methods.,4
0,"Observation and rovibrational analysis of the intermolecular HCl libration band 16 of HCN–HCl, DCN–HCl and HCN–HCl",9
1,The high-resolution far-infrared absorption spectrum of the intermolecular HCl libration band 16 () of the gaseous molecular complex HCN–HCl and the two isotopically substituted species HCN–HCl and DCN–HCl is recorded by means of static gas-phase Fourier transform far-infrared spectroscopy at 205 K using an electron storage ring source.,3
2,The rotational structure of the 16 band has the typical appearance of a perpendicular type band of a linear polyatomic molecule.,8
3,"The structure is analyzed using a standard semi-rigid linear molecule model including -type doubling to yield the band origin , together with values for the upper state rotational constant ′, the upper state quartic centrifugal distortion constant ′ and the value for the -type doubling constant .",6
4,The values for the ground-state spectroscopic constants ″ and ″ for DCN–HCl and HCN–HCl are determined for the first time by ground state combination difference analyses.,8
5,A number of 16 + 17 − 17 and 16 + 2 − 2 hot bands are observed in the spectra and the sum of the anharmonicity constants  +  is estimated.,5
6,The observed decrease of the rotational constant  together with the simultaneous increase of the quartic centrifugal distortion constant  upon excitation of the HCl libration mode indicate that the hydrogen bond in the molecular complex is significantly destabilized upon intermolecular vibrational excitation.,5
7,The calculated harmonic force constants for the intermolecular hydrogen bond stretching vibration  for the ground state and the excited HCl libration state indicate that the excitation of the HCl libration mode destabilizes the intermolecular interaction between HCN and HCl by almost 20%.,5
8,The hydrogen bond is elongated by 0.030 Å upon excitation of the 16 mode.,5
9,"The high-resolution infrared absorption spectrum of a bimolecular complex provides detailed information about the forces acting between the two molecular species defined by intermolecular potential energy surface (IPES), as well as how the intramolecular force fields within the subunits are modified by the incorporation into the bimolecular entity.",1
10,"The accurate characterization of the IPES for a molecular complex requires the observation and analysis of a wide variety of gas phase spectra of fundamental bands, overtone bands, hot bands, combination bands, not only for the parent species but also for a sufficient number of isotopomers.",1
11,The low-wavenumber intermolecular vibrational degrees of freedom depend directly on the properties of the IPES and are therefore of special importance.,1
12,Infrared absorption spectra of hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes have been a subject of a long range of studies in the literature.,1
13,"However, only a few numbers of these studies have dealt with the important intermolecular part of the vibrational spectrum for such molecular complexes.",1
14,The reason appears to be that there exist few suitable spectroscopic radiation sources in the far-infrared spectral region where the floppy intermolecular vibrations of molecular complexes are normally observed.,1
15,Measurements of rotationally resolved absorption spectra of intermolecular vibrations of gaseous molecular complexes require a spectral resolution close to the Doppler limit in the far-infrared spectral region.,1
16,"However, the steep fall-off of energy with decreasing frequency for conventional black body radiators means that far-infrared spectroscopy generally is energy-limited at normal source temperatures in the sense that the resolution which can be attained is ultimately limited by the intensity of the source.",1
17,"Far-infrared synchrotron radiation from an electron storage ring provides a far more brilliant source than conventional black body radiators, if the noise problems connected with electron beam oscillations can be solved.",1
18,A high-brightness source of far-infrared synchrotron radiation is therefore suitable for measurements in which high spectral resolution and high sensitivity is needed simultaneously.,1
19,This was demonstrated in our earlier publication on the intermolecular HCl libration band of the linear hydrogen-bonded heterodimer OC–HCl.,1
20,In the present work we investigate the high-resolution far-infrared absorption spectrum of the gaseous hydrogen-bonded heterodimer of HCN and HCl.,9
21,"In contrast to the wealth of spectroscopic information available for the closely related prototype dimer HCN–HF (see  and references therein) and to a lesser extent for (HCN) (see , and references therein) the spectroscopic information about the molecular complex HCN–HCl reported in the literature is rather limited.",1
22,The first observation of the isolated molecular complex between HCN and HCl in the gas phase was reported by Legon . who used Fourier transform microwave (MW) spectroscopy conducted in a Fabry–Perot cavity with a pulsed nozzle molecular source.,1
23,"In this study, accurate ground-state spectroscopic constants were determined for the parent isotopic molecular complex and three additional isotopomers containing D, N and Cl.",9
24,"Interpretation of the spectroscopic constants led to the conclusion that the most stable configuration of the molecular complex of HCN and HCl is collinear or near collinear at equilibrium, establishing the presence of a hydrogen bond to the N atom of the HCN molecule.",4
25,The vibrationally averaged distance between the centers of mass of the two monomers was determined to be 3.9380 Å.,8
26,Bender . observed and assigned the intramolecular C–H stretching vibration band  of HCN–HCl using a static gas long-path absorption cell at 199 K interfaced with a tunable single-frequency color-center laser spectrometer.,1
27,"Bender . also managed to make tentative assignments of the three hot bands  + 17 − 17,  + 227 − 227 and  + 337 − 337 where 17 is the doubly degenerate low-wavenumber intermolecular bending vibration (libration of HCN).",1
28,The assignment of the  band was later slightly modified and extended by Block and Miller.,1
29,The observed small red shift of 2.5 cm for the band origin of  of HCN–HCl relative to the C–H stretching vibration band of monomer HCN indicates that the hydrogen bond is rather unaffected by excitation of the  mode.,1
30,In a recent study the present authors reported the observation and rovibrational analysis of the intramolecular H–Cl stretching vibration band  of HCN–HCl.,1
31,A red shift of 107 cm of the  band of HCN–HCl relative to the H–Cl stretching vibration band for monomeric HCl together with a positive value of Δ upon vibrational excitation of  showed that the hydrogen bond strengthens upon intramolecular vibrational excitation of the  mode.,1
32,The intermolecular hydrogen bond vibrations of the HCN–HCl complex have not been observed directly.,1
33,Bender . estimated the band origin of the intermolecular HCN libration band 17 to be 41(3) cm from the value of the -type doubling constant.,1
34,The same authors estimate the harmonic frequency for the intermolecular hydrogen bond stretching vibration  () to be 100(5) cm from the ground-state spectroscopic constants using the modified pseudo diatomic (MPD) approximation developed by Millen.,1
35,The harmonic frequency for the intermolecular HCl libration band 16 () is computed to be 311 cm in the  study by Araújo,1
36,"The present study reports the direct observation and rovibrational analysis of the intermolecular HCl libration band of HCN–HCl, DCN–HCl and HCN–HCl by means of static gas-phase Fourier transform far-infrared spectroscopy and a far-infrared synchrotron radiation source.",9

51,The transfer optics are described elsewhere.,10
52,The CsI exit window from the electron storage ring is mounted at Brewster’s angle to the horizontally polarized radiation.,10
53,"The plane of polarization is then converted to vertical, since far-infrared beam splitters are more effective with this polarization.",10
54,"The electron storage ring is a high-brightness source of broadband infrared radiation, covering the full far-infrared spectral region.",10
55,Synchrotron radiation is very close to a point source and is very suitable for high-resolution infrared spectroscopy.,1

58,"The detector is a liquid He cooled Si-bolometer operating at 1.7 K (Infrared Laboratories, Inc)..",10
59,"The detector element is small, and allows us to use high scanning speeds.",10
60,The high scanning speeds make the bolometer less sensitive to motions of the electron beam.,10
61,A cold band pass optical filter (0–370 cm) is mounted in the bolometer in order to reduce the photonic noise level and detector nonlinearity effects in the final spectra.,10
62,"The combination of optical filters at the bolometer, the 6 μm multilayer beam splitter and the CsI cell and exit windows gives a band pass in the region 190–370 cm.",10
63,"The FTS instrument resolution (RES) is defined as RES = 0.9/(MOPD), where MOPD is the maximum optical path difference in the interferometer.",10
64,Sample interferograms are recorded with a resolution of 0.005 cm (MOPD = 180 cm).,10
65,The recorded sample interferograms are transformed using Mertz phase correction and boxcar apodization.,10
66,A total scan time for each spectrum of  10 h is achieved.,10
67,Throughout the measurements the FTS is evacuated by a vacuum pump reducing absorption by atmospheric gasses in the optical path inside the FTS.,10
68,Background interferograms of the evacuated absorption cell are recorded with a resolution of 0.08 cm.,10
69,These are transformed and interpolated onto a wavenumber grid matching that of the sample spectra using a zero-filling factor of 16.,10
70,This background resolution is appropriate in order to cancel out the most dominant interference fringes.,10
71,The resulting signal-to-noise ratio in the final absorbance spectra is about 20 : 1 for the most intense observed transitions.,8
72,The absolute wavenumber scale of the absorption spectrum is calibrated against published rotational lines of HO observed in the spectrum.,10
73,The HO lines appear in our spectra due to residual water vapor in the evacuated interferometer tank.,10

78,"The appearance of the main band is typical for a linear molecule perpendicular type band (Σ–Π) with a rather large negative value for Δ, as may be expected for the HCl libration motion of the HCN–HCl complex.",5
79,This observation together with the fact that the HCN–HCl system has high symmetry in the equilibrium configuration suggest that a standard semi-rigid linear molecule model is suitable for the present spectral analysis.,4
80,The central Q-branch of the band is located at 331.4 cm and degrades widely at lower wavenumbers.,8
81,The Q-branch is accompanied by weaker P- and R-branches; the R-branch forms a band head near 335.4 cm while the P-branch shows increasing -spacing at lower wavenumbers.,8
82,"The Q-branch and the P-branch are assigned to  = 65 and 53, respectively.",8
83,"For the R-branch the band head appears for  = 55, 56.",8
84,This branch is therefore assigned up to  = 46.,8
85,Fig. 1 shows part of the -assignment of the Q-branch and Fig. 2 shows part of the -assignment and the observed band head for the R-branch.,8
86,The total number of rovibrational transitions assigned to the 16 band of HCN–HCl is listed in Table S1 which is available as ESI.,5
87,A number of additional weak absorption lines is observed in the Q-branch region for HCN–HCl.,8
88,Fifteen of these weak lines are picked out and assigned to Q-branch transitions with  ∈ [27;50] for HCN–HCl by use of computer-assisted Loomis–Wood diagrams.,5
89,It is not possible to identify any P- and R-branch lines for the Cl isotopomer and the Q-branch -assignment cannot be verified by ground state combination differences (GSCDs).,5
90,The assigned Q-transitions in the 16 band of HCN–HCl are listed in Table S2 as ESI.,5
91,"In order to determine the values of the upper state spectroscopic constants ′ and ′ ( = l) for HCN–HCl the standard semi-rigid linear molecule model based on the following rovibrational energy expressions for the vibrational ground state, ″, and excited vibrational state, ′, is used:″ = ″( + 1) − ″( + 1)′ =  + ′( + 1) − ′( + 1) ± (1/2)( + 1)In the fit the ground-state constants ″and ″ are constrained to the MW values for HCN–HCl reported in .",6
92,"It appears that the effective Δ value obtained from the Q-branch fit is larger than the Δ value from the P, R-branch fit.",5
93,This indicates the presence of -type doubling which is accounted for in eqn. (2).,5
94,"The plus sign is used for the analysis of the Q-branch; the minus sign is used for the analysis of the P,R-branch system.",6
95,"Including the -type doubling constant  in the model the P, Q, and R-branch transitions are analyzed simultaneously.",6
96,"A least-squares fit of a total number of 95 rovibrational transitions determines the values of , Δ, Δ and  listed in Table 1.",5
97,"The -assignment of the Q-branch and the determination of the spectroscopic constants , Δ and Δ for the HCN–HCl isotopomer are based on a fit of the 15 observed transitions to the conventional diatomic molecule expression given in eqn. (3):() =  + Δ( + 1) − Δ( + 1)Since the polynomial fit is based solely on observed Q-branch transitions the determined value of Δ is affected by -type doubling.",5
98,The actual value is therefore an effective rotational constant Δ ± 0.5.,5
99,The -assignment leading to the fit with minimum standard deviation is chosen.,3
100,The resulting spectroscopic constants are listed in Table 1.,8
101,"In the analysis of the  band for HCN–HCl by Bender . the hot band progressions  + 17 − 17,  + 227 − 227 and  + 337 − 337 from the low-wavenumber hydrogen-bond bending vibration 17 were observed.",1
102,"A similar hot band pattern consisting of rovibrational structures centered at  325, 320 and 315 cm is observed in the present spectrum.",8
103,These features seem to consist of Q-branch lines only.,5
104,It is not possible to assign corresponding P- and R-branch lines which makes it difficult to establish the definitive -assignments of the Q-branch lines.,5
105,"From a tentative -assignment of the 325 cm feature, which is assigned to the 16 + 17 − 17 hot band, the band origin is estimated to be 325.690(5) cm.",5
106,The following sum of anharmonicity constants is estimated based on the band origin of the main band located at 331.400 cm: +  = −5.710(5) cmThe spectral feature observed at  320 cm is assigned to the hot band 16 + 227 − 227 and the band origin is estimated to be 320.155(10) cm from a tentative -assignment of the Q-branch.,5
107,The following sum of anharmonicity constants is estimated assuming as in  that this hot band involves the  = 2 component: +  = −5.622(5) cmwhich is in reasonable agreement with the result for 16 + 17 − 17.,5
108,We predict the band origin of the 16 + 337 − 337 ( = 3) hot band at 314.4 cm from the average value of  +  of −5.67 cm.,5
109,It is difficult to locate the beginning of the Q-branch due to the weak intensity of this hot band.,8
110,"However, an estimate of the band origin of 314.60(15) cm seems reasonable, and this is taken as a further confirmation that our assignment of the hot band progressions is consistent.",5
111,The far-infrared absorption spectrum of the mixture of DCN and natural isotopic HCl shows rotational resolved structures which are almost identical to the structures observed for the HCN/HCl mixture and are assigned to the 16 band of DCN–HCl and DCN–HCl and weak hot band progressions of DCN–HCl.,5

118,An additional number of weak absorption lines is observed in the Q-branch region for DCN–HCl.,5
119,A series of 31 weak lines is picked out and assigned to the Q-branch with  ∈ [12;70] for the DCN–HCl isotopomer.,5
120,"The assigned transitions for DCN–HCl are listed in Table S4, provided as ESI.",5
121,The present P- and R-branch assignments allow us to perform a ground-state combination difference (GSCD) analysis for DCN–HCl.,10

127,The -assignment leading to the fit with minimum standard deviation is chosen and the resulting spectroscopic constants are listed in Table 1.,5
128,A hot band pattern with rotational resolved features at  325 and 320 cm is observed in the absorption spectrum.,8
129,These features are assigned to the 16 + 17 − 17 and 16 + 227 − 227 hot bands for DCN–HCl and are assumed to consist of Q-branch lines.,5
130,"Tentative -assignments of these Q-branches yield the band origins of 326.50(10) cm and 321.60(20) cm, respectively.",5
131,The observed shifts of 5.20(10) and 10.10(20) cm relative to the main band give the following average value for the sum of anharmonicity constants: +  = − 5.12(14),5

142,The assignment and rovibrational analysis of the 27 observed Q-branch lines in the 16 band of HCN–HCl is based on the conventional diatomic molecule expression given in eqn. (3).,6
143,The -assignment leading to the fit with minimum standard deviation is chosen and the resulting spectroscopic constants are listed in Table 1.,5
144,A single Q-branch structure is observed in the spectrum around 326 cm.,5
145,The Q-branch is assigned to 16 + 17 − 17 hot band for HCN–HCl and the sum of anharmonicity constants  +  is estimated to be −5.42(14) cm.,5
146,"The appearance of the rotational structure of the HCl libration band 16 and, in particular, the presence of -type doubling observed in the far-infrared absorption spectra confirms the collinearity of the atoms in the molecular complex HCN–HCl.",4
147,The observed decrease of the rotational constant  together with the simultaneous increase of the quartic centrifugal distortion constant  upon excitation of the HCl libration mode indicate that the hydrogen bond in the molecular complex is significantly destabilized upon intermolecular vibrational excitation.,4
148,In terms of electrostatics the observed destabilization may be understood from the angular dependence of the dominant dipole–dipole interaction energy between HCN and HCl.,4
149,"The dipole–dipole interaction between HCN and HCl can be described by a simple potential energy function:where  and  are the electric dipole moments of HCN and HCl, respectively,  and  are the libration angles (the angles between the two monomeric species and the line between the centers of mass), ( − ) is the dihedral angle and  is the center of mass separation.",4
150,In the harmonic oscillator approximation based on the HCl libration band origin and the rotational constant for HCl the classical HCl bending amplitude  increases from 14.4° in the ground state to 20.3° upon excitation of the HCl libration mode for HCN–HCl.,5
151,The electric dipole moment of HCl is tilted away from the intermolecular symmetry axis in the molecular complex as the HCl subunit carries out the librational motion and the dipole–dipole interaction becomes more unfavorable owing to the enhanced non-linearity of the configuration.,4
152,In an attempt to quantify this destabilizing effect we use the relations between the determined centrifugal distortion parameters and the parameters of the analytical Morse potential function derived by Larsen,6
153,"In this work the values of the Dunham parameters ,  and  were related to the Morse potential parameters ,  and  and used to characterize the intermolecular potential energy surface for the stretching of the hydrogen bond in the linear OC–HCl complex.",6
154,"The center of mass separation  between HCN and HCl is related to the rotational constant according to:where  is the rotational constant of the molecular complex,  and  are the moments of inertia for the HCN and HCl subunits and  is the reduced mass of the molecular complex.",6
155,The values for the moments of inertia of the subunits are taken from .,6
156,The harmonic frequency  for the intermolecular stretching vibration of the hydrogen bond is related to the rotational constant and quartic centrifugal distortion constant  by eqn. (6) assuming that the dominant contribution to the centrifugal distortion of the center of mass distance comes from the hydrogen bond stretching vibration:,6
157,"In Table 2 the estimated center of mass distance and harmonic frequency for the hydrogen bond stretching vibration are listed for the ground state and the excited HCl libration state for HCN–HCl, DCN–HCl and HCN–HCl.",5
158,The corresponding harmonic force constants  which are correlated directly to the dissociation energies of the molecular complexes are also listed in Table 2.,5
159,It appears that the hydrogen bond elongates by 0.030 Å upon excitation of the HCl libration mode for all three complexes.,5
160,The harmonic frequency for the hydrogen bond stretching vibration for HCN–HCl decreases from  100(5) to 90(5) cm upon excitation of 16 and the corresponding harmonic force constant thereby decreases by 19%.,5
161,These values are the same as those obtained using Millen’s modified pseudodiatomic approximation.,5
162,The estimated force constants suggest that the excitation of the HCl libration mode destabilizes the intermolecular interaction between HCN and HCl by almost 20%.,4
163,"This very pronounced destabilizing effect due to excitation of the high-wavenumber intermolecular bending mode  of the molecular complex has also been observed for other hydrogen bonded systems like HCN–HF, OC–HCl and (HO).",4
164,In the strong HCN–HF dimer the hydrogen bond weakens by  20% upon excitation of the HF libration mode and for the weaker OC–HCl dimer the hydrogen bond is destabilized by almost 30% upon excitation of the HCl libration mode.,1
165,Furthermore Keutsch . showed that the lifetime of the doubly hydrogen bonded water trimer decreases by three orders of magnitude upon single excitation of the intermolecular out-of-plane libration mode.,1
166,"Unfortunately, the Morse model described in  cannot give values for the dissociation energy  of the molecular complex without values for the sextic centrifugal distortion constant .",1
167,In an attempt to quantify the relative dissociation energy from the determined values for the ground-state spectroscopic constants Legon . used the Lennard-Jones 6/12 potential function.,3
168,This potential energy function may not provide an entirely satisfactory description of the radial behavour of the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction but has the clear advantage that it allows the dissociation energy of the molecular complex to be estimated from the values of  and  alone.,3
169,Legon . estimate the dissociation energy for HCN–HCl to be 1199 cm in the simple pseudodiatomic approximation.,1
170,Standard  molecular orbital theory calculations are carried out using the program package GAUSSIAN 98 in order to validate the empirical value for the dissociation energy.,6
171,"Geometry optimization procedures are performed for HCN, HCl and HCN–HCl using CCSD(T) methodology in combination with correlation consistent polarized valence double-, triple- and quadruple zeta basis sets including polarization and diffuse functions.",6
172,"Single-point energy calculations on selected geometries are performed in order to calculate BSSE corrections being assessed using the counterpoise (CP) correction, as suggested by Boys and Bernadi.",10
173,The calculated dissociation energies for the HCN–HCl dimer corrected for the BSSE are listed in Table 3.,5
174,In order to estimate the basis set limit we use the results of Dunning.,6
175,"In this work, the BSSE corrected values of  for (HO) and (HF) were calculated using the CCSD(T) level of theory in combination with the aug-cc-pVZ basis sets,  = 1–4.",1
176,The conclusion of this work was that the basis set convergence errors for (HO) and (HF) for a specific basis set are very similar.,1
177,"For (HO), the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory yields 94% of the value for the basis set limit.",1
178,Assuming this to be true also for the HCN–HCl dimer we predict a dissociation energy  of −1530 cm in the complete basis set limit.,5
179,The computed value for the center of mass distance at equilibrium is 3.910 Å at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory which is close to the empirical value.,5
180,It is interesting to note that the band origins for the HCl librations of HCN–HCl and DCN–HCl are slightly blueshifted relative to the band origin for the HCl libration of HCN–HCl.,8
181,In the harmonic oscillator approximation we expect that the HCl libration frequencies are lower for the heavier isotopomers.,7
182,We consider the following potential energy function for the two libration modes given in eqn. (9):where  and  are the libration angles and  −  is the dihedral angle.,6
183,We estimate the importance of the third term in the potential energy function involving the mixed harmonic force constant  assuming that the HCN libration and the coupling between the libration modes are dominated by the dipole–dipole interaction ( = 1/2).,6
184,The values of the force constant  are estimated from Bender,6
185,In this way we estimate how much the HCl libration frequencies are blueshifted due to the coupling with the HCN libration.,6
186,The estimated differences in these shifts upon isotopic substitution are much smaller than the observed blueshifts and it seems that the fourth term in the potential energy function involving the anharmonic force constant  is more important for the couplings.,4
187,"If we assume that this anharmonic term also determines the shifts of the observed 16 + 17 − 17 hot bands, we can estimate the HCl libration shifts expected from the  term alone.",6
188,"We obtain 0.539 and 0.073 cm for the frequency shifts upon isotopic substitution of D and C, respectively, compared to the observed values of 0.302 86(33) and 0.088 46(33) cm.",5
189,"In the present study, we report the direct observation and rovibrational analysis of the intermolecular HCl libration bands 16 for gaseous HCN–HCl, HCN–HCl and DCN–HCl by means of static gas-phase Fourier transform far-infrared spectroscopy at 205 K using an infrared synchrotron radiation source.",9
190,A limited number of Q-branch lines are observed and assigned for the 16 bands of the corresponding Cl species in natural abundance.,5
191,A number of 16 + 17 − 17 and 16 + 227 − 227 hot bands are observed in the spectra and sums of the anharmonicity constants  +  are estimated.,5
192,The relative HCl libration band origins seem to be determined from the anharmonic coupling to the HCN libration modes.,4
193,The observed decrease of the rotational constants  together with the simultaneous increase of the quartic centrifugal distortion constants  upon excitation of the HCl libration modes indicate that the hydrogen bond in the molecular complexes is significantly destabilized upon excitation of the intermolecular HCl libration modes.,4
194,The estimated force constants for the intermolecular hydrogen bond stretching vibration suggest that the excitation of the HCl libration mode destabilizes the intermolecular interaction between HCN and HCl by almost 20%.,4
195,The hydrogen bond elongates by 0.030 Å upon excitation of the 16 mode for all three complexes.,5

4,"The results are presented, discussed and used to estimate the atmospheric lifetimes for the studied alcohols.",0
5,Alcohols are emitted into the atmosphere by a wide number of anthropogenic and natural processes.,1
6,The main sources are due to their use as solvent in different industries.,1
7,"For example, 2-methyl-1-propanol (isobutanol) is commonly used in coatings, as an additive in gasoline, an intermediate for glycol ethers and agricultural chemicals, and in anti-corrosion and anti-wear additives in engine oils.",1

10,"The release of these oxygenated volatile organic compounds is likely to contribute to the formation of ozone and other components of photochemical smog such as aldehydes, ketones and PAN-type compounds in urban areas.",1
11,"To assess the impact of these chemical species on the environment, a detailed understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms of their atmospheric degradation is required.",2
12,The gas-phase atmospheric oxidation of alcohols is primary initiated by reaction with OH radicals.,1
13,Several kinetic studies of the OH reaction with alcohols have been reported previously.,1
14,"However, only a limited number of studies have been conducted on the absolute measurements of the OH reaction rate constant with alcohols with more than four carbon atoms.",1
15,"In this article, we report the rate coefficient data for the reactions of OH radicals with 2-methyl-1-propanol (), 3-methyl-1-butanol () and 3-methyl-2-butanol (): OH + (CH)CHCHOH→products: OH + (CH)CHCHCHOH→products: OH + (CH)CHCH(OH)CH→products: Experiments were carried out using two different techniques.",9
16,The pulsed laser photolysis–laser induced fluorescence (PLP-LIF) technique was used to determine the absolute rate coefficients for the above reactions in the temperature range 241–373 K at around 100 Torr while the relative method enabled us to conduct the measurements at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.,3
17,"As far as we know, this work provides the first temperature dependence studies for the three reactions.",1
18,The only existing data reported in the literature are those of Hai . for 2-methyl-1-propanol Saunders . for 3-methyl-1-butanol and Wallington . for 3-methyl-2-butanol.,1
19,The present work also aims at extending the kinetic data base to be used to develop structure-reactivity relationships for OH reaction with oxygenated VOCs.,0
20,The experimental set-up used to measure the relative rate constant consisted of a 120 L Teflon bag and lamps positioned in a wooden box with the internal faces covered with aluminium foil.,3
21,Measured amounts of reagents were flushed from calibrated bulbs into the Teflon bag through a stream of ultra pure air.,10
22,The photoreactor was then filled to its full capacity at atmospheric pressure with ultra-pure air.,10
23,OH radicals were produced by photolysing HO using lamps emitting at 254 nm (Sylvania G30W) and illuminating the hole gas sample.,10
24,"A gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionisation detector (GC-FID, CP-3800 or Star 3600 CX, Varian) was used for the quantitative analysis of the reactants.",3
25,"Chromatographic separation was achieved by using a DB-1 capillary column (J&W Scientific, 30 m, 0.25 nm id, 5 μm film).",10
26,"The column was operated at the temperature of 318 K, and helium was used as the carrier gas.",10
27,"The pulsed laser photolysis–laser induced fluorescence (PLP-LIF) technique and the methodology used have been described in detail previously [ in ], only a brief description is given here.",3
28,Hydroxyl radicals were produced by photolysis of HO at  = 248 nm (KrF excimer laser) and their concentration was monitored at various reaction times ranging from about 10 μs to 10 ms by pulsed laser induced fluorescence.,10
29,A Nd:YAG-pumped frequency-doubled dye laser was used to excite the OH radicals at  = 282 nm.,10
30,"Fluorescence from the OH radicals was detected by a photomultiplier, fitted with a 309 nm narrow bandpass filter.",10
31,The output pulse from the photomultiplier was integrated for a preset period by a gated charge integrator.,10
32,Typically the fluorescence signal from 10 different delay times and 100 probe laser shots were averaged to generate OH concentration-time profiles over at least three lifetimes.,10
33,HO was introduced into the reaction cell by passing a small flow of helium through a glass bubbler containing HO solution.,10
34,Alcohols were premixed with helium in a 10 L glass bulb to form 0.2–0.6% mixture at a total pressure of about 850 Torr.,10
35,"The gas mixture, the photolytic precursor (HO), and the bath gas (helium) flowed through the cell with a linear velocity ranging from 3 to 10 cm s.",10
36,The gas mixture illuminated was then renewed every two laser shots.,10
37,"The concentrations of the reactants were calculated from their mass flow rates, the temperature, and the pressure in the reaction cell.",6
38,All flow rates were measured with mass flow meters calibrated by measuring the rate of pressure increase in a known volume.,10
39,The pressure in the cell was measured with a capacitance manometer connected at the entrance of the cell.,10
40,The helium carrier gas (UHP certified to >99.9995% (Alphagas)) was used without purification.,10
41,"The 50 wt % HO solution, from Prolabo, was concentrated by bubbling helium through the solution to remove water for several days prior to use and constantly during the experiment.",10
42,"2-methyl-1-propanol (≥99.8 %), 3-methyl-1-butanol (≥99.5) and 3-methyl-2-butanol (≥99.5%) were from Fluka, they were further purified by repeated freeze, pump, and thaw cycles and fractional distillation before use.",10
43,"Relative rate constants were measured by comparing the OH reaction rate with alcohols to that with reference compounds:OH + alcohol → products: OH + reference → products: Assuming that the compounds are only consumed by reaction with OH, it can be shown that:ln([alcohol]/[alcohol]) = (/)ln([ref]/[ref])where the subscripts 0 and  indicate concentrations before irradiation and at time , respectively.",6
44,"The rate constant for the reaction of OH with the three alcohols were measured at (298 ± 3) K and 760 Torr, relatively to the rate constant of OH with 1-butanol and 1,3-dioxolane.",10
45,The concentrations of alcohols and references were in the range 30–100 ppm.,10
46,The compounds showed a good stability when they were mixed in the chamber with HO and kept in the dark for about 1 h.,8
47,"Moreover, in absence of HO, the photolysis of the mixtures (alcohols and references in air) for more than one hour did not show any decrease in the concentrations.",8
48,Fig. 1 shows an example of the obtained relative loss of alcohols versus that of the reference compounds in the presence of OH.,8
49,"In Table 1, the obtained rate constant ratios are given along with the derived rate constants for the OH reactions with the three alcohols.",8
50,"The rate constants of the reaction of OH with the references used in this work were taken as (8.47 ± 0.34) × 10 for 1-butanol, and (11.1 ± 0.9) × 10 cm molecule s for 1,3-dioxolane.",6
51,"While averaging the values from different experiments, we obtained: = (0.92 ± 0.15) × 10 cm molecule s. = (1.4 ± 0.2) × 10 cm molecule s. = (1.25 ± 0.2) × 10 cm molecule s.The quoted errors represent twice the standard deviation, to which we have added an estimated error of 10% on the reference rate constants.",5
52,Kinetic experiments have been performed under pseudo-first-order conditions with the concentration of alcohols in large excess over that of OH concentration ([alcohol] > 100[OH]).,10
53,"Typically, the initial OH concentration, [OH], was around 2×10 molecule cm.",10
54,The rate of disappearance of the OH radical followed a simple exponential rate law:[OH] = [OH]e where ′ =  [alcohol] + ′ represents the rate constants for the reaction of OH with the three alcohols.,6
55,The decay rate ′ is the first-order OH disappearance rate in the presence of the alcohol and ′0 is the first-order rate constant for OH removal in absence of alcohol (attributed to the diffusion of OH radicals out of the detection zone and to their reaction with HO).,6
56,"Typically, alcohol and HO concentrations were in the ranges (1.6–92)×10 and (1–10)×10 molecule cm, respectively. ′0 and ′ were in the ranges 60–140 s and 200–13000 s, respectively.",10
57,Experiments were conducted in the temperature range 241–373 K and a total pressure of (106 ± 5) Torr of helium.,10
58,"In all conditions, the OH decays were found to be exponential over at least three lifetimes.",8
59,The high [alcohol]/[OH] ratios and low OH concentrations made negligible contribution from secondary reactions involving the products of reactions to the measured rate constants.,5
60,"The contribution of the reaction of OH with photofragments of alcohol was negligible since alcohols are not photolysed at 248 nm, the wavelength used to generate OH radicals.",1
61,"As expected, variation in the photolysis fluence (3–26 mJ cm) had no effect on the determined rate constants.",8
62,The three alcohols were purified to better than 99.5% and hence loss of OH radicals by reaction with impurities in the gas mixtures is expected to be insignificant.,4
63,Fig. 2 shows examples of the plots of ′ versus the alcohol concentrations obtained at 298 K.,8
64,The obtained values of – and the experimental conditions are listed in table 2.,8
65,"The room temperature rate constant taken as the average of all values obtained at (298 ± 2) K are: = (1.0 ± 0.1)×10 cm molecule s. = (1.5 ± 0.1)×10 cm molecule s. = (1.2 ± 0.1)×10 cm molecule s.The quoted errors for – include 2 from the least-squares analysis and the systematic error (5%, due to uncertainties in measured concentrations).",5
66,These values are in good agreement with those obtained by the relative method.,4
67,The measured values of – shown in Table 2 are plotted in the Arrhenius form in Fig. 3.,8
68,"An un-weighted least squares analysis of the ln  1/ plot yields the following expressions for the temperature dependence of – in the temperature range 241–373 K (in units of cm molecule s ): = (3.1±0.9) × 10exp[(352±82)/] = (2.8±0.9) × 10exp[(503±98)/] = (2.6±0.6) × 10exp[(456±65)/]Uncertainties are 2 and 2, for  and /, respectively.",5
69,The rate constants obtained in this work are compared with the previously reported data in Table 3.,9
70,"For isobutanol, the measured value of  at room temperature is in good agreement with that obtained by Wu . using the relative rate method.",8
71,"These authors measured  relative to the rate constant of OH reactions with propane and cyclohexane and obtained (9.08±0.35) × 10 and (9.94±0.47) × 10 cm molecule s, respectively.",1
72,"Wu . measured also the rate constant for the reaction of OH with 3-methyl-1-butanol using the same references, they obtained (13.8±0.5) × 10 and (13.7±1.1) × 10 cm molecule s with propane and cyclohexane, respectively.",1
73,Our measured value of  and that of Wu . are in agreement with that previously reported by Saunders . using the discharge flow–laser induced fluorescence (DF-LIF) technique at 1 Torr total pressure and 298 K ( = (13.1±2.6) × 10 cm molecule s).,8
74,"For 3-methyl-2-butanol, our value of  at room temperature agrees with that reported earlier by Wallington . obtained using the flash photolysis–resonance fluorescence technique ( = (12.4±0.7) × 10 cm molecule s).",8
75,"This work provides the first temperature dependence parameters for the OH reaction with 2-methyl-1-propanol, 3-methyl 1-butanol and 3-methyl 2-butanol.",1
76,"The results show a negative temperature dependence for ,  and  similarly to other alcohols for which temperature dependence data are available such as n-propanol, i-propanol and n-butanol.",5
77,The present rate constant values – can be compared with those calculated from the structure–activity relationship (SAR) of Atkinson based on group reactivity using the revised substituent factors (–OH) = 2.9 and (–CHOH) = (CHOH) = (COH) = 2..6,9
78,"To calculate – we used also the following parameters as defined by Kwok and Atkinson: (–CH) = 1, (–CH–) = (CH–) = (C) = 1.23,  = 0.136,  = 0.934,  = 1.94 and  = 0.14 (k are in units of 10 cm molecule s) where (–CH), (–CH–), (CH–), and (C) are the substituent factors and , ,  and  represent the rate constants for the H-atom abstraction from –CH, –CH–, CH–, and –OH, respectively.",6
79,The calculated – values compared to the experimental ones (in brackets) are  = 0.89 (0.96) ;  = 0.92 (1.45) and  = 1.28 (1.23) (units of 10 cm molecule s).,8
80,"While the experimental values of  and  are in good agreement with the calculated ones, that of  is a factor of 1.6 higher than that calculated using the SAR.",8
81,It has to be noticed that this kind of discrepancy between the experimental and calculated rate constants values for the reaction of OH with hydroxyl-containing organic compounds has already been mentioned earlier.,1
82,The measured  value supports the statement of Bethel . indicating that accurate estimation of OH radical rate constants for all hydroxyl-containing compounds (to within better than a factor of two) does not appear possible using the general approach of the SAR developed by Atkinson.,5
83,One of the possible reasons for this discrepancy is that the SAR of Atkinson considers only effects of the OH substituent on H-atom abstraction at the α- and the β- positions for hydroxyl-containing compounds while the available data shows that the oxygenated functional groups have long-range effects with respect to H-atom abstraction at sites remote from the substituent groups.,4
84,"This long-range effect indicates an alternative pathway to the direct concerted hydrogen abstraction process such as the formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex in which, first, a hydrogen bond is formed between the H atom of the OH radical and the O atom of the oxygenated compound then a second hydrogen bond is formed between the O atom of the OH radical and a H atom in the hydrocarbon chain, resulting in intermolecular H-atom transfer via a cyclic transition state.",1
85,"In all cases, the resulting reaction is an abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the oxygenated substrate.",1
86,"At room temperature, reaction of OH radicals with alcohols proceeds mainly by an H-atom abstraction process from the C–H bonds of the CH–, –CH- and CH– groups with a minor contribution of the H-atom abstraction from the -OH group.",5
87,"Product distribution studies on the reaction of OH radicals with long chain linear alcohols in the presence of NO in air have shown that H-atom abstraction from different positions (α, β, or γ) to the –OH group makes a significant contribution to the total reaction.",1
88,"Under atmospheric conditions, the resulting hydroxy alkyl radicals react with oxygen.",1
89,"The α-hydroxy alkyl radicals formed through H-atom abstraction from the CH group bonded to OH react solely with O to lead to carbonyls:RR′CHOH + OH → RR′C˙OH + HORR′C˙OH + O → RR′C(O) + HOThe other hydroxy alkyl radicals (β, γ, ) react with O and NO to lead to different alkoxy hydroxy radicals which then react with O or decompose.",1
90,"In addition, recent mechanistic studies have suggested that isomerization of this type of intermediate oxy radicals may also be important in the oxidation of long chain alcohols, through a six-membered transition state, leading to the formation of hydroxyketones and hydroxyaldehydes.",1
91,"In the gas phase, the primary degradation step of alcohols in the troposphere is reaction with OH radicals since other processes such as reactions with O and NO, and photolysis are of minor importance.",1
92,"The measured OH reaction rate constants () along with a typical OH concentration of [OH] = 2 × 10 molecule cm, can be used to estimate the tropospheric lifetimes ( = 1/[OH]) of the studied alcohols.",1
93,The derived lifetimes are around 10 h for the three alcohols which indicate that these compounds are quickly removed from the atmosphere and give rise to other stable products that have longer lifetimes such as acetone.,5
0,Enzymatic preparation of biotinylated naturally-occurring sialylglycan and its molecular recognition on a quartz-crystal microbalance,9
1,"A biotinylated sialylglycan was prepared enzymatically by -M, and binding behavior of an SSA lectin was studied on a different coverage of a sialylglycan-immobilized 27 MHz quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM).",9
2,"Glycoconjugates such as glycolipids and glycoproteins on cell membranes play an important role of receptor to lectins, toxins and viruses in living systems, and are significantly related to the formation of organized systems such as cell adhesion, differentiation and morphogenesis.",1
3,"In order to elucidate the function of glycoconjugates on the cell surface, it is necessary to design a suitable glyco-microarray.",2
4,"However, the immobilization of carbohydrates on a substrate or chip due to complexed structures of glycoconjugates is still unexploited compared with that for nucleic acids and proteins.",1
5,"The simple way for this purpose is to immobilize directly naturally-occurring glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and glycolipids on a substrate; however, this is not suitable for studying the role of the carbohydrate itself such as in molecular recognition.",3
6,"It was developed to immobilize only the synthetic sugar chains on a substrate by using chemical methods such as Diels–Alder reactions and activated esterification; however, it required complicated chemical treatments such as the selective protection and de-protection of certain functional hydroxyl groups.",3
7,"It is also common to achieve the immobilization through a Schiff's base linkage using an aldehyde group of a reducing end of a carbohydrate with an amine or hydrazide group; however, this method has a disadvantage of collapsing the reducing end.",3
8,"In this communication, we have prepared a biotinylated naturally-occurring sialylglycan by enzymatic transglycosylation of -β-acetylglucosaminidase from , as shown in a step (a) of Fig. 1.",10
9,The biotinylated sialylglycan was immobilized on an avidin-covered 27 MHz quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) [step (b)].,10
10,SSA lectin from  could recognize specifically the sialyl(α2-6)Gal/GalNAc sequence independent of the surface coverage (5–80%) of the carbohydrate [step (c)].,1
11,"The 27 MHz QCM is known as a mass measuring device, which has been calibrated as the 1 Hz frequency decrease corresponding to the 0.62 ng cm mass increase on the QCM electrode in the aqueous solution as well as in the air phase.",10
12,"The calibration of the 27 MHz QCM in the aqueous solution is described in the ESI, as compared with in the air phase.",10
13,"In the preparation of the biotinylated sialylglycan, we chose -β--acetyl glucosaminidase from  (EC 3.2.1.96) (-M) as an enzyme, which is a unique endoglycosidase for the hydrolysis of ,′-diacetylchitobiosyl linkages in oligosaccharides bound to asparaginyl residues of various glycoproteins to leave one -acetylglucosamine residue on the protein moieties.-M was found to hydrolyze not only the high mannose type but the complex type and the hybrid type of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides.",1
14,"Furthermore, -M also showed transglycosylation activity.",1
15,Sialylglycopeptide (SGP) was separated from hen's egg yolk according to a previous method.,10
16,"SGP (340 µg, 12 mM) was reacted with biotinylated GlcNAc (38 µg, 2.1 mM) in the presence of -M (30 mU in 30 µL) in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 at 37 °C [step (a) in Fig. 1].",10
17,"The biotinylated sialylglycan could be prepared in 55–60% yield after 5 h of reaction, and it was purified by HPLC (C column, eluent: CHCN containing trifluoroacetic acid) and confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS (matrix: DHB, +Na: 2619.4, calibrated with insulin).",10
18,The yield was comparable to that of the transglycosylation to glucose and aliphatic alcohols as acceptors (30–50%).,8
19,"On an Au electrode (4.9 mm) of a 27 MHz QCM plate (8 mm diameter) of AffinixQ, NeutrAvidin was immobilized as a monolayer coverage through an amine coupling with dithiopropionic acid according to previous methods.",10
20,NeutrAvidin was chosen as a biotin-binding protein because carbohydrates on the avidin have been removed to reduce non-specific binding.,10
21,"When an aqueous solution of sialylglycan was injected to the NeutrAvidin-covered QCM plate, the frequency decreased (mass increased) depending on the concentration of sialylglycan (10–600 nM), and the immobilized amount could be controlled to be 5–60 ng cm (1.9–23 pmol cm) on the QCM through biotin–avidin linkages [step (b) in Fig. 1].",5
22,This corresponds to approximately 3–60% coverage of the NeutrAvidin surface on the QCM.,5
23,"In the presence of an excess amount of biotin in the solution, the biotinylated sialylglycan did not bind to the NeutrAvidin-immobilized QCM, and the non-biotinylated sialylglycan also hardly bound to the NeutrAvidin surface (see ESI Fig. S1).",8
24,"The state and orientation of the sialylglycan on the QCM chip was confirmed by binding of SSA lectin from , which is known to recognize specifically the NeuAc(α2-6)Gal/GalNAc sequence of carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates [step (c) in Fig. 1].",3
25,"As shown in Fig. 2, when SSA lectin was injected to the sialylglycan surface (5–80% coverage) on the QCM, the frequency decreased (mass increased) with saturation behavior.",8
26,SSA lectin bound weakly to the GlcNAc surface and NeutrAvidin surface due to the non-specific binding to the surface.,5
27,"Thus, SSA lectin specifically recognizes the surface of NeuAc(α2-6)Gal/GalNAc of the immobilized sialylglycan.",4
28,"From saturation binding measurements, the maximum binding amount (Δ) and binding constant () could be obtained according to eqn. 1,where [SSA] is the initial concentration of SSA lectin.",6
29,"Values for Δ and  were obtained at different immobilized amounts of sialylglycan on the QCM, and the results are shown in Fig. 3.",3
30,Both  and Δ values were independent of the immobilized amount of sialylglycan (5–80% of surface coverage).,8
31,"value was obtained as 2.5 ± 0.4 × 10 M, which is similar to  = 6.7 × 10 M obtained for SSA lectin binding to the NeuAc(α2-6)Gal(β1-4)Glc moiety by a surface plasmon resonance method, and  = 9.5 × 10 M for SSA lectin binding to glycolipid monolayers having NeuAc(α2-6)Gal headgroups.",5
32,The slightly low  value of 3.4 × 10 M was obtained in the bulk solution.,5
33,"The maximum binding amount of SSA lectin was estimated to be 410 ng cm as a monolayer adsorption of globular proteins of  = 160 kDa, which is consistent with the obtained value of Δ = 480 ± 40 ng cm.",5
34,"Thus, SSA lectin can recognize the NeuAc(α2-6)Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc sequence of sialylglycan independent of the surface coverage of 5–80%.",4
35,SSA lectin is an AB-type tetramer and a sectional area is roughly calculated to be 16 nm.,5
36,"This is very large relative to that of sialylglycan (0.6–0.8 nm), and  30 sialylglycan molecules are calculated to be covered under one SSA lectin binding.",5
37,This means that the existence of less than 3% of sialylglycan is enough to bind SSA lectin as a monolayer adsorption.,4
38,"In conclusion, we can prepare the biotinylated naturally-occurring sialylglycan by enzymatic transglycosylation in a high yield, and the state or orientation of sialylglycan can be assayed by using a QCM technique.",9
39,We believe that the combination of the biotinylation of naturally-occurring carbohydrates by the -M enzyme and the QCM chip assay will be very useful for the elucidation of roles of carbohydrates and studies on glycomics.,1
0,Geometrical  statistical models for describing phase transition kinetics in thin films,1
1,"We present calculations and simulations to investigate different theories describing phase transitions in thin films, with special emphasis on the growth of the new phase after nucleation.",9
2,"In particular, models with geometric and statistical growth rules are compared.",9
3,"It is demonstrated that the commonly employed  approach, which assumes nucleation and subsequent radial growth of the newly formed phase, has distinct limitations for thin film systems.",8
4,"More realistic statistical Monte Carlo simulations that are governed by  growth rules, predict that a non-spherical (prolate) shape may develop after nucleation at or near a surface or interface.",8
5,"In addition, the predicted kinetics of the phase transformation is notably different for the geometric  the statistical model, for similar parameters.",8
6,The simulation results are compared to recent experiments on the crystallization of thin amorphous solid water films.,9
7,"The transformation of materials from the amorphous to the crystalline phase and its theoretical description have received considerable attention due to its relevance for areas as diverse as polymer science, interstellar physical chemistry, semiconductor technology and metallurgy.",1
8,"Particular attention has been paid to the kinetics of this transition in thin films, for reasons of experimental sample geometry and to mimic finite-size effects in naturally occurring systems.",1
9,"For example, the crystallization of amorphous solid water in confined geometries has received significant attention the past decade.",1
10,"There has recently been renewed interest in theories that predict the crystallized fraction as a function of time (as this constitutes the commonly measured quantity), and its sensitivity to the various parameters associated with the phase transition: the nucleation probability, the rate of subsequent growth and the desorption rate of material from the thin films, if pertinent.",1
11,These analytical theories (see ) are based on Avrami’s seminal contribution and assume that nucleation sites are randomly distributed throughout the volume (or over the surface) of the initial phase and appear with a fixed probability per unit volume (per unit surface area) per unit time.,1
12,"The subsequent growth is radial, with a constant velocity.",1
13,"In these models, the growth criterion is therefore  and geometric: if a point within the layer is sufficiently close to a nucleation center, it will have changed phase.",1
14,"At any point in the layer, the probability for conversion therefore does not depend on the local environment of that point, but depends on how far it is removed from a crystallization nucleus and how much time has elapsed after nucleation, hence the denotation geometric, or non-local.",1
15,The geometric model has recently been extended to include the different desorption rates from the different phases in simulations by Ahlström,3
16,"Although this geometrical model has been successfully applied in a number of cases, it does not account for the finite size of the (molecular) elements in the system.",3
17,"As a continuum model, the geometrical approach implicitly relies on a sample size well exceeding the size of its molecular constituents; this approximation therefore must break down when the sample size is on the order of typical molecular diameter.",3
18,"For very small samples, a , statistical description for the growth would seem more appropriate.",3
19,"In such a statistical model, the probability for, say, a water molecule to become part of the crystalline phase, is determined by the phase state of its immediate surroundings in a statistical manner; if the surrounding is predominantly crystalline, the chance of phase transformation will be large.",1
20,"To investigate possible shortcomings of the non-local geometrical model in finite-size systems, we compare the results of geometrical models with the results of the most basic statistical (local) model that predicts spherical growth in bulk media: an atomistic lattice model simulation based on a Monte Carlo approach.",0
21,"As opposed to the non-local growth rule of the geometric model, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are characterized by statistical growth behavior in the following manner: a film is subdivided into cells, and the individual cells can crystallize depending on the state of their direct neighbors.",6
22,"The growth criteria for the MC simulation are the simplest that reproduce three-dimensional spherical growth in the bulk, without any prior knowledge of the energetics of the process.",1
23,"Although both approaches therefore in principle give rise to the same shape of crystalline domains, a comparison of the MC simulations of the crystallization and growth process (using local, statistical criteria) with the Avrami-type (non-local) geometrical approach for finite sized systems reveals distinct differences between the two methods.",8
24,"First of all, we demonstrate that the statistical model predicts that the growth rate depends on the size of the converted region, and therefore on time, as opposed to the geometric model that assumes time-independent growth rate.",5
25,This effect is not limited to thin films.,1
26,Additional discrepancies appear when nucleation occurs at or near the surface or an interface of a thin film.,8
27,"Whereas, again, for the geometrical model the growth rate is constant, for the statistical model the presence of the surface decelerates crystal growth near the surface.",8
28,"As a result, for the MC simulation, the transformed region does not exhibit the shape of a truncated sphere, as predicted by geometrical models, but rather by a truncated prolate spheroid.",5
29,"This is not a purely abstract issue, as there have recently been two independent reports for nucleation of the thermodynamically stable phase at the surface: for the crystallization of amorphous solid water and polymers.",1
30,"As we are interested in very thin films, the film dimensions will be expressed in monolayers (ML) throughout this paper, corresponding to approximately one molecular diameter.",6
31,Time will simply be expressed in seconds.,6
32,"The phase transformation in a thin film, such as the crystallization of amorphous solid water, requires the nucleation and growth of small crystalline domains in the amorphous phase.",1
33,"In the two models described here, nucleation occurs in the same manner, but the growth rules differ.",1
34,"Nucleation occurs at random times at random positions within the layer, or on its surface.",1
35,The nucleation probability for bulk nucleation is defined per unit volume per unit time  (expressed in ML s).,6
36,"For nucleation occurring at the surface, it is defined per unit surface area per unit time  (expressed in ML s).",6
37,"The energy barrier that must be overcome to form a crystalline nucleus is determined by, amongst other, a competition between the surface tension that arises between the two phases upon nucleation (counteracting nucleation) and the difference in chemical potential between the two phases (favoring nucleation, as the crystalline phase is thermodynamically most stable).",6
38,"As a result, the instantaneously converted volume (critical nucleus size) that appears upon nucleation will contain a significant number of molecules (previously reported to be ∼100 for water crystallization).",6
39,"The size of the, assumed to be spherical, critical nucleus is defined by its radius * (expressed in ML).",6
40,"The subsequent growth of crystalline domains is modeled in two different manners, as introduced above: through a geometric criterion, and by statistical growth rules, that are explained in the following.",1
41,"For the MC simulations, a cubic lattice of (100 × 100 × 50) cells is employed, and the different cells are distinguished by their spatial coordinates (,,).",6
42,The choice of 50 for the thickness was motivated by recent experiments on the crystallization of amorphous solid water in which a layer thickness of approximately this number of molecules was employed.,6
43,"Note, however, that the results described here are not specific to this thickness.",1
44,"In any case, this comparison to experiment implies that each cell corresponds to one water molecule.",6
45,"Any of the cells may be untransformed (amorphous) or transformed (crystalline), defined with cell values  = 0 and  = 1, respectively.",6
46,The phase state of each cell is evaluated in every time step Δ employed in the simulations.,6
47,"The nucleation process is treated in the following manner: For each time step, the discrete number of nucleation events is determined by the nucleation probability , in conjunction with the system volume  and time step Δ employed in the simulations.",6
48,"This number is obtained from a simulated Poisson distribution, whose mean is given by the product Δ.",6
49,"For surface nucleation, the Poisson mean is given by Δ, with  the surface area on which nucleation occurs.",6
50,"The critical nucleus size, whose size is defined by its radius *, subsequently grows using local, statistical growth rules: a cell at position (,,) has a certain probability of crystallizing either as a result of a nucleation event, or a growth event if one of its 26 neighboring cells is crystalline.",6
51,"This means that the probability for conversion of the cell is determined by its immediate surroundings (local), as opposed to the geometrical (non-local) growth rule, which simply considers the distance from a nucleation center (see below).",1
52,"Note that, as depicted in Fig. 1, a cell has three types of neighbors:  = 6 direct neighbors that share a face, at a distance of the unit cell size ,  = 12 neighbors that share an edge at a distance of √2, and  = 8 neighbors that share a corner point, at a distance of √3.",8
53,"The probability  for the crystallinity to propagate to an adjacent cell is inversely proportional to the geometric distance, and linearly proportional to elapsed time.",6
54,It is important to note that these growth criteria are the simplest that ensure spherical growth in three dimensions (growth through just nearest-neighbor faces results in a diamond-shaped volume).,1
55,"It is evident that the criteria for spherical growth such as defined here for a cubic lattice, with hopping probability inversely proportional to the geometric distance to a neighbor, are readily extrapolated to other types of lattices.",8
56,"Ideally, one would like the growth criteria to be determined by the energetics associated with the growth process.",1
57,"Unfortunately, however, for most systems (as is also the case for the transition from amorphous solid water to crystalline ice), very little is known about these energetics.",1
58,Therefore we adopt this statistical approach.,1
59,"At every time step, for each cell that has not yet been transformed, the state of its 26 neighbors is evaluated.",6
60,"The probability that during this time step this cell will transform equals:with summations over the cell values  of the different types of neighboring cells: ,  and  ( = 1 (or 0) for an (un)transformed cell).",6
61,"represents the probability to propagate  a face, which is proportional to the time step size and the growth rate.",6
62,"A random number between zero and one is then computer generated, and if this number is smaller than , the value of the cell  changes from zero to one as a result of crystallization.",6
63,"Otherwise, it remains unchanged.",1
64,"Care was taken to ensure that the results were independent of the size of the time step used in the simulations,  to keep  sufficiently small.",6
65,"From a set of simulations with varying time step size, it is clear that, if  is set to be smaller than 0.015 per time step, the results converge.",8
66,"In the simulations reported here, we set  = 0.01 per time step.",6
67,"For convenience, time is expressed in seconds in the remainder of this report.",1
68,"To account for contributions of spheres nucleated outside, but grown into, the considered (100 × 100 × 50) volume, the simulation volume is embedded in a larger volume (typically (300 × 300 × 50)),  the lateral dimensions (but not the thickness) of the simulation volume are enlarged by an amount determined by the product of the maximum growth rate and the total simulation time.",6
69,The (100 × 100 × 50) volume is then analyzed to determine the time-dependent converted fraction.,6
70,"We did not use periodic boundary conditions, as the statistical fluctuations in nucleation and growth rates are amplified in that way.",1
71,"Desorption was included in some of the simulations in a non-statistical manner, simply by reducing the layer thickness from the top as a function of time.",6
72,"The presented results are averages of 30 simulation runs, to reduce the effects of statistical fluctuations in the growth process.",6
73,A set of 30 simulations typically takes 10 h on a desktop personal computer.,6
74,The converted volume as a function of time can be obtained by evaluating the summation of cell values over all cells:  = ∑.,6
75,The time-dependent crystalline fraction is given by dividing  by the total considered simulation volume.,6
76,"The time-dependent crystallinity at the surface or at the sample–support interface can be obtained analogously (experimentally, the thin water layers are deposited on a support).",6
77,"For the model that assumes geometrical (non-local) growth, nucleation occurs as described above, but the description of the growth of the nucleus is governed by geometric considerations: growth simply occurs radially from a nucleation center at geometric rate  (in units ML s).",6
78,"Thus, if nucleation of the new phase occurs at time , and the nucleus has an initial radius *, then the radius  of the sphere at time  > equals  = * +  ( − ).",6
79,"It is therefore evident that any cell at position (,,) is crystalline if the inequality:is satisfied, for any of the nucleation sites (,,).",6
80,"If one is interested in the overall kinetics ( the converted crystalline fraction as a function of time) one can derive analytical expressions describing the kinetics, as reported in detail in .",1
81,The essence of the derivation of these expressions is that the converted (crystalline) volume is calculated as a function of time for all nucleated regions.,1
82,"Because the nucleation probability per unit volume and unit time, , is independent of elapsed time and position, so-called ‘phantom nuclei’ may appear in already transformed regions and transformed regions may overlap.",1
83,"This approach results in the calculation of a time-dependent  volume () ( doubly counting overlapping regions), from which the real crystalline volume () follows through the relation () = 1 − exp[−()].() is calculated by considering all possible nucleation events,  by integrating the function (,) over all times  up to time .",6
84,The result can be directly related to the converted fraction of bulk material.,1
85,"Following (neglecting the desorption of material from film), this results in the following expression for (), for a layer of thickness :Similar expressions for the surface and sample–support interface crystallinities can be readily derived following the procedure in , as well as the corresponding expressions for surface nucleation.",6
86,These expressions including desorption can be found in the same reference.,1
87,"In analogy to the statistical growth criterion, one can also perform simulations using a non-local, geometric criterion, as demonstrated previously in .",1
88,"The results of such simulations for the non-local geometric approach are in perfect agreement with the analytical results, the only difference being the discrete nature of the lattice in the simulation that gives rise to a quantized increase in the converted fraction.",5
89,"Two types of investigations were performed: one with fixed nucleation site, and one with random nucleation throughout the film.",3
90,The first allows us to investigate the differences between statistical and geometric growth rules regarding the  of the transformed volume.,3
91,"Two limiting cases are considered: nucleation in the center of the film at cell (,,) = (50,50,25), and on the surface at (50,50,1), at time  = 0 s.",6
92,"In the second case (random nucleation throughout the film) we investigate the effect of the different types of simulated growth on the time-dependent fraction of converted material, to mimic typical experimental approaches.",9
93,"For each of these cases (fixed and random nucleation), statistical and geometric growth criteria were employed.",3
94,The results for fixed nucleation site will be discussed first.,1
95,"We first consider nucleation in the precise center of the film, at cell (,,) = (50,50,25), with a critical nucleus consisting of only one cell.",6
96,The parameters used in the simulation were Δ = 0.1 s and  = 0.01 per time step Δ.,6
97,"Although both models indeed produce spherical growth, a number of striking differences appear between the two models.",8
98,"The first is that the rate of radial growth, which is defined as constant in the non-local geometric model, increases in the course of time in the MC simulations for statistical growth by a factor of 6.",8
99,"For the non-local geometrical model, the growth rate  is simply defined as the rate of change in the sphere radius ,  = ∂/∂.",6
100,"In the MC simulation, for statistical growth, the sphere is not necessarily perfectly round and compact, but we can still define an  radius  by calculating the radius corresponding to the converted volume  = ∑, as if it were a perfect sphere: .",6
101,"Thus, we can compare the geometric non-local growth rate with that observed in the statistical MC simulations by comparing  with the time-dependent radial growth rate in the MC simulations defined as:  = ∂/∂.",6
102,These quantities are plotted  time in Fig. 2.,8
103,The time range (0–14 s) is sufficiently small so that the sphere does not reach the sample edges.,1
104,"For the parameter set Δ = 0.1 s and  = 0.01, the long-time growth equals ∼1.58 ML s for the MC simulations.",5
105,"For the non-local geometric model, the growth rate is set to be  = 1.58 ML s in eqns. (2) and (3) and is, of course, time-independent.",5
106,The increase in the growth rate observed in the statistical MC model can be understood as follows: consider an untransformed cell at the edge of the transformed volume.,1
107,"In the very beginning, there is only one pathway for the considered cell to become transformed, through the face of the adjacent, initially transformed cell at (50,50,25).",1
108,"In other words, the curvature of the crystallized ‘sphere’ is so large, that only one pathway is available.",1
109,"When the radius becomes very large (and the curvature small) a cell bordering the transformed volume will experience the oncoming transformed front as a flat front, and there will be  pathways for the cell to become transformed: one as before, and an additional eight from cells sharing cube edges and corner points (four and four, respectively).",1
110,The growth probability per time step therefore increases from  at small times to ( + 4/√2 + 4/√3) at large times.,6
111,"For growth along a linear, one-dimensional chain, it is clear that the growth rate is given by  = 2/Δ, the factor of two accounting for the fact that growth will occur in two directions.",6
112,"This should also be the  growth rate for our system, as borne out in the simulations:  = 0.2 ML s for  → 0 (see Fig. 2).",8
113,"For long times, one might expect a growth rate of ( → ∞) = 2( + 4/√2 + 4/√3)/Δ = 1.23 ML s, following the reasoning above.",7
114,"The observed long-time growth rate is larger than this simple estimate, amounting to ∼1.58 ML s.",8
115,"This is due to the fact that there are additional, indirect pathways through the three-dimensional system (not considered in the simple argument presented above) that contribute to the growth rate.",4
116,"We find the phenomenological relationship  ( → ∞) ≈15.8 /Δ, which will be used below.",1
117,"The black line in Fig. 2 is the prediction of the time-dependent growth rate from the aforementioned simple considerations: this calculated rate is related to the curvature of the sphere, 1/ through  = 1.58 − 1/.",6
118,It provides a reasonable description of the simulation results.,5
119,Hence it is evident that the main contribution to the time-dependent growth rate originates from the time-dependent curvature of the transformed sphere.,4
120,"It should be noted that the limiting large-radius value for ,  ( → ∞), is reached relatively soon, in terms of the transformed volume, as demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 2.",5
121,"For example, for a critical nucleus containing 100 cells ( water molecules), the initial growth rate is 0.7 , rather than 0.13  for a nucleus of size one.",5
122,"Besides the different growth rates, a second marked difference between the statistical and the geometrical model is that the transformed region reaches the surface appreciably earlier for the statistical MC results, .",5
123,"This is illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows the radii of the two differently growing spheres.",8
124,The plot depicts  − the bulk radius derived from the volume of the sphere – and  – the radius of the circle of the exposed area of the sphere at the surface.,1
125,"The expressions for  and  read: , as introduced above, and, analogously, ,  proportional to the square root of the area associated with cells that have crystallized at the surface.",1
126,"It is evident from Fig. 3 that for identical long-time growth rates ( =  ( → ∞) = 1.58 ML s), the transformed sphere reaches the surface at  = 13 s for the MC simulation, and at  = 16 s for the non-local geometrical model, despite the fact that the radius of the geometrical sphere is ∼20% greater than the effective radius of the (statistical) MC result at this time, owing to the delayed initial growth for the MC sphere.",5
127,"Whereas the geometrically grown sphere is fully compact, the MC sphere is not; it has a fill factor of roughly ∼80%, with a strongly non-uniform crystalline density (the center is mostly crystalline).",5
128,"As a result, the sphere may reach the surface before  = 25 ML, which is the geometric criterion for reaching the surface.",4
129,"The non-compact nature of the MC sphere is illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 3, which depicts a slice through the -plane at  = 25 for a sphere that nucleated at point (50,50,25),  through the center of the sphere, from one randomly chosen simulation run.",8
130,"It is evident that in real life, the precise shape of a cross section such as presented in Fig. 3 is the result of many competing factors, such as entropy (favoring a ‘rough’ sphere surface), surface tension (favoring a perfect circle) by possible variations in local growth rate due to  density fluctuations and varying growth rates along different crystallographic axes.",1
131,"Neither of the models presented here takes these effects into account, as very little is known about these effects.",1
132,"In addition, potential effects of the underlying support that is present in the experiments are neglected, as these effects can be suppressed for appropriate substrates.",1
133,A third difference between crystal growth determined by statistical and geometric rules is the shape of the crystalline domain in the proximity of the surface(s).,1
134,"Whereas for the non-local (geometrical) case, this shape is always a (truncated) sphere, for the statistical growth criterion the domain deviates from spherical growth, resulting in a deformed crystalline domain shape.",1
135,"This is most clear for nucleation immediately at the surface (center placed at point (50,50,1)).",1
136,"This is illustrated in Fig. 4, which depicts the simulation volume projected onto one of its sides,  integrated over one of the coordinates parallel to the surface: () = ∑, for both the non-local geometrical and the statistical MC model.",8
137,"In addition to the non-spherical behavior of the MC model, it is also clear from Fig. 4 that the  nucleation site is situated ∼5 cells below the surface (at  = 5), although the real site is at  = 1.",5
138,This is clearly observed from the contour lines (also plotted in the graph).,8
139,"This somewhat surprising result can be understood in the following manner: Consider 2 cells, at the same distance from the surface nucleation site (N), but one straight down into the bulk (A) and one in the plane of the surface (B).",1
140,"In the non-local, geometrical growth model, as the distances N–A and N–B are identical, A and B become crystalline at the same point in time, and lie on the same contour line.",1
141,"With the statistical (local) growth rules, crystallization of cells A and B can occur through one of the many pathways by which the crystalline front can propagate from cell N. However, due to the broken symmetry at the surface, it is clear that there are roughly twice as many pathways from N to A, as there are from N to B, as the crystalline phase cannot propagate through vacuum.",1
142,"As a result, growth of the nucleus along the coordinate parallel to the surface plane is slower than growth along the coordinate perpendicular to the surface.",1
143,A consequence of this behavior is that the exposed surface area of the converted volume is smaller than what one would expect from the non-local geometric model.,1
144,"This effect can be quantified by considering the ratio of  (now defined as , since only half a sphere is formed) and , defined as above.",6
145,"The anisotropy in / is a good measure for the deviation from spherical behavior, as, in case of surface nucleation, it always equals 1 for the geometrical model.",6
146,"Fig. 5 represents the time-dependent anisotropy in apparent radii in the bulk and at the surface, and demonstrates that this effect is largest for short times.",5
147,"As mentioned already briefly above, it should be stressed that both the models described here are phenomenological and neither explicitly takes into account the thermodynamic quantities that are relevant for the crystallization and growth process.",1
148,"In particular, for the crystallization of water, which is driven by the difference in chemical potential between the two phases, the nucleation and growth will be determined by surface tension between the two phases and density effects.",1
149,"For instance, the effect of the density difference between the amorphous and the crystalline phase (0.94 g cm and 0.93 g cm, respectively) will raise the nucleation barrier, and presumably impede growth of larger crystallites due to strain effects.",1
150,"For crystalline grains reaching the surface, additional contributions arise: first, the three-phase line tension must be taken into account, which will raise the free energy as a larger part of the surface is converted, and therefore will slow down the growth along the surface.",1
151,"Secondly, there is a surface tension difference between the amorphous–vacuum interface and the crystalline–vacuum interface.",1
152,"Unfortunately, the magnitude, and sometimes even the sign, of many of these quantities are unknown.",1
153,This is one of the motivations for taking the most simple approaches to both the statistical and geometric growth.,2
154,"To investigate to what extent the aforementioned effects influence the interpretation of experimental results, we investigate the quantity that is generally determined experimentally: the time-dependent fraction of converted material.",0
155,"Although both surface and bulk fractions are experimentally accessible, for simplicity we will first restrict ourselves to the bulk fraction, for nucleation of the new phase occurring in the bulk of the material.",3
156,We use values for the nucleation and growth parameters that have been reported previously for crystallization kinetics of thin water films:  = 2.0 × 10 ML s and  = 5.0 × 10 ML s.,6
157,"Whereas  is uniquely defined in both the non-local geometric and the statistical MC simulations, the growth rate  is only in the former, as in the MC simulations,  depends both on time and the initial critical nucleus size.",6
158,"In the simulations, we choose the numerical parameters  and Δ such that GMC ( → ∞) = 5.0 × 10 ML s, since  ( → ∞) = 15.8 /Δ (see above).",6
159,"To be as realistic as possible, we chose a critical nucleus size of not only * = 0.5 ML (corresponding to a nucleus of one cell in diameter) but also * = 3 ML, the latter corresponding to a critical nucleus containing 93 cells (the specific value of 93 is dictated by the discrete character of the lattice), in agreement with previous estimates of the critical nucleus.",6
160,The Monte Carlo approach is further detailed in the section ‘approach’ above.,1
161,"The results of these simulations for both the non-local geometric and statistical MC models are depicted together in Fig. 6; there is a clear discrepancy between the results of the two models, despite the identical nucleation parameters.",8
162,"It is interesting to note that in both cases the shapes of the two curves are nearly identical, but the MC result is offset in time due to the time-dependent growth rate.",8
163,"As expected, the temporal offset is largest for * = 0.5 ML, as the initial growth rate for the small nucleus is relatively low (see Fig. 2).",5
164,"For the case of * = 3.0 ML, the geometrical model describes the kinetics observed in the MC simulations best with parameter values  = 6.0 × 10 ML,  = 7.0 × 10 ML s (keeping * fixed at 3.0 ML),  significantly different from the parameter values used in the simulations.",5
165,"Finally, we make a direct comparison to experiments recently reported in .",9
166,"In these experiments, surface crystallization of a thin amorphous water film was reported.",1
167,"Here, we compare results of the geometric and statistical models with previously inferred crystallization parameters:  = 4.5 × 10 ML s,  = 0.17 ML s,  = 0.04 ML s and * = 3.0 ML.",1
168,"The results of the calculations, performed for a layer of 45 ML thickness (instead of 50 ML as in the previous part of this paper), are plotted in Fig. 7, from which it is immediately evident that the results of the two models are not very different.",8
169,The main difference is the smaller temporal separation between the calculated surface and bulk fractions for the statistical model compared to the geometrical one.,5
170,"This is a consequence of the non-spherical shape that appears for surface nucleation in the statistical model, with growth lagging in the surface plane; As a result, the surface crystallinity is retarded compared to the geometrical case.",4
171,"The observation that there is no significant time lag for all three curves (as opposed to the results presented in Fig. 6) can be understood by noting that, for the  nucleation parameters used in the calculations, the crystalline growth advances through the layer as one front, as depicted in the inset in Fig. 7.",5
172,"As nucleation occurs in one plane, the converted regions appear close to each other, allowing them to merge relatively soon.",1
173,"The long-time growth rate  ( → ∞) is therefore reached at an early time, also due to the relatively large * = 3.0 ML.",5
174,"It is evident that for these nucleation parameters, the difference between statistical and geometrical growth is rather small; this, however, is not necessarily true for other systems, and depends intricately on the values of the nucleation parameters.",5
175,We have investigated the effect of different crystallization models on the observed phase transition kinetics in thin films.,9
176,A simple statistical Monte Carlo routine is presented that allows us to follow the phase transition in space and time.,3
177,"A comparison between the result of these Monte Carlo simulations and the routinely employed geometric models reveal a time-dependent growth rate for statistical growth, whereas the growth rate is assumed constant for geometric models.",5
178,"Moreover, the assumed spherical shape for geometric models is not observed for statistical growth for nucleation at or near a surface.",5
179,"A comparison to recent experimental results demonstrates that the consequences of these effects on the analysis of experimental data in thin films depend on the precise nucleation parameters, and may be small.",4

6,"Theoretical work in this area was pioneered by Pyykkö, who used Hartree–Fock (HF) and perturbation theory (MP2) methods to study the aurophilicity (metallophilicity between gold atoms) in [X–Au–PH] dimers, where X is one from a range of groups such as the halogens, methyl and SCH.",3
7,"The structure studied in most detail was the C symmetric arrangement shown in Fig. 1a, in which the P–Au–Au–P dihedral angle is fixed at 90° in order to zero the leading dipole–dipole term between the two monomers, and hence to allow more unencumbered focus on the aurophilicity.",3
8,Pyykkö's calculations were extremely revealing.,1
9,At the HF level the monomer interaction energy curves are repulsive; an aurophilic attraction only manifests itself when electron correlation is introduced at the MP2 level.,1
10,"It was therefore concluded that aurophilicity is due to electron correlation (or, put another way, van der Waals or dispersion forces), and also that the attraction is strengthened by relativistic effects.",1
11,"The latter issue was revisited by Pyykkö in 1997, when it was concluded that relativistic effects are important but not dominant.",1
12,"For example, a 27% increase in the interaction energy of two Cl–Au–PH monomers was found on going from a non-relativistic to a relativistic Au pseudopotential using monomer geometries optimised at the relativistic level.",1
13,"If non-relativistic monomer geometries are used, the use of a relativistic pseudopotential in the interaction energy calculation produces only a 15% relativistic energy enhancement.",1

18,"Magnko  confirmed what Pyykkö  had discovered previously, that the strength of the metallophilic interaction in [Cl–M–PH] (M = Cu, Ag, Au) increases as the metal becomes heavier, by approximately 50% from Cu ( 22 kJ mol) to Au.",1
19,"The LMP2 analysis revealed that the interaction between the monomers has several components, and that the relative magnitude of these changes quite significantly as group 11 is descended.",1
20,"Electron correlation is not purely attractive; intramolecular correlation contributions (double excitations localized on one monomer) are repulsive,  30–50% of the total LMP2 interaction energy.",1
21,"Furthermore, the attractive intermolecular correlation contributions arise from both van der Waals and ionic excitations, with the latter being 60–100% of the former at .",1
22,"Perhaps most interestingly, the attractive part of the correlation does not arise solely from M(d)–M(d) interactions.",1
23,"Pure Au(5d)–Au(5d) pair correlation amounts to no more than 35% of the total LMP2 attraction in [Cl–Au–PH], and this decreases to only 13% in the analogous Cu compound.",1
24,"Pair correlations involving only one or neither M(d) centre make up the bulk of the attractive part of the correlation; for Cu, pair correlations involving neither Cu(3d) centre are the leading term.",1

32,"Pyykkö  used MP2, MP3 and MP4(SDQ) to study [H–Au–PH] and [Cl–Au–PH], extending their [H–Au–PH] calculations to the CCSD and CCSD(T) levels.",3
33,"They found that the values of the interaction energy oscillated quite strongly as the higher level methods were introduced, and noted “this area will require further investigation”.",3
34,"Magnko  acknowledge a potential problem with the MP2 approach,  that it overestimates van der Waals attractions, and state “our MP2 results for the interaction energies….may well be too large by anything between 0 and 25%”.",3
35,We therefore felt that there was scope to explore metallophilicity in these group 11 dimers using methods beyond MP2.,2
36,"To that end we report in this contribution the results of our studies into [Cl–M–PH] (M = Cu, Ag, Au, [111]), using HF, MP2, QCISD and coupled cluster approaches.",9
37,We have also conducted density functional theory calculations.,3
38,"While we acknowledge that, as Magnko  note, “van der Waals like attraction cannot be reliably described with current DFT schemes”, we were interested to see how DFT techniques fare in the metallophilicity arena.",0
39,DFT has a reputation for producing the correct answer for unreliable reasons.,3
40,"As a final extension of previous work, we were keen to probe the metallophilicity in [Cl–[111]–PH] ([111] = element 111),  to study all four members of group 11.",9
41,"It is now well established that there are four rows of the d-block, and we are currently embarking on an investigation of the chemistry of the transactinide (6d) elements.",2
42,The first results of this investigation are reported here.,1
43,All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 98 and MOLPRO 20023. program suites.,3
44,The approach typically taken was to initially optimise the geometry of the [Cl–M–PH] monomer using Gaussian 98 (gradients are not available in MOLPRO for pseudopotential basis sets).,6
45,"For the higher level  methods, we then encountered problems when performing calculations on the dimeric systems using Gaussian 98, as we frequently came up against the 16 GB limit on the scratch files (under 32-bit linux for Intel).",3
46,For the calculations of the metallophilic interaction (method described more fully in the main text) we therefore used the MOLPRO code.,3
47,"This package seems to generate smaller scratch files for a given calculation, and we have also found that it is appreciably faster than Gaussian 98 for closed shell QCISD and couple cluster calculations (by up to a factor of 10).",8
48,"In all post-Hartree–Fock calculations, the lowest 16 (monomer) and 32 (dimer) molecular orbitals were not included in the correlation window.",6
49,Basis set superposition errors have been accounted for using the counterpoise correction.,6
50,"The choice of basis sets is important in all quantum chemistry, but particularly so when studying metallophilicity (a combination of the inherent weakness of the effect and the potential for BSSEs).",1
51,"Pyykkö  found that, when studying [X–M–PH] (X = H, Cl; M = Cu, Ag and Au) at the MP2 level, 19 valence electron pseudopotentials should be used for the metals.",1
52,"They also found that, for Au at least, diffuse s, p and d functions were not required in the valence basis set, but that two f polarisation functions were needed (one compact and one diffuse).",1
53,A DZP valence basis plus accompanying pseudopotential was employed for the non-metallic elements.,1
54,"Not surprisingly, more recent studies have employed bigger basis sets.",1
55,"The LMP2 work of Schütz, Werner  employed correlation consistent basis sets for the non-metallic elements, together with more extended metal basis sets than used by Pyykkö.",1
56,The Cu bases used by Schwerdtfeger  were also reasonably large.,1
57,"In the present study we were of course conscious of the desirability of using the biggest possible basis sets, but that this must be weighed against the feasibility of performing QCISD and coupled cluster calculations, particularly geometry optimisations.",1
58,"For the bulk of our work we have therefore used the following combination of basis sets, designated basis α.",1
59,"The 6-31G** basis sets have been used for Cl, P and H. For Cu, Ag and Au we followed Pyykkö’s procedure of supplementing the relativistic Stuttgart 19 valence electron pseudopotentials and accompanying valence basis sets (Cu; Ag and Au) with two f polarisation functions.",6
60,"The more diffuse f function was obtained by maximising the MP2 polarisability of the monocation, while the more compact f function was chosen so as to minimise the total CCSD(T) energy of the neutral atom.",6
61,The f exponents obtained in this manner are given in Table 1.,8
62,For [111] we used the relativistic pseudopotential and accompanying basis set devised by Seth,6
63,"As this basis set already contains f polarisation functions, we did not alter it in any way.",6
64,"Unless otherwise stated, all calculations have been performed with basis α.",6
65,"In order to gauge the effect of basis set size on our results, we have conducted some MP2 and CCSD(T) single point calculations using bigger basis sets.",3
66,"Basis β includes the same metal basis sets as basis α, except that the 2f functions for Cu, Ag and Au given in Table 1 were replaced with the 3f2g functions of .",6
67,"For P and Cl, the basis set was improved to 6-311G*, while that for H was unaltered.",6
68,"Finally, basis γ is the same as β, but with the P and Cl basis sets improved to 6-311+G*.",6
69,For Au and [111] we have also performed some comparative non-relativistic calculations.,3
70,"For Au, the non-relativistic pseudopotential and valence basis set of Schwerdtfeger . was employed, supplemented by two f functions obtained as described above for the relativistic case (yielding  = 0.22 and 1.17).",6
71,"For [111], the non-relativistic pseudopotential and basis set (including f polarisation functions) of Seth . was employed.",6
72,"The geometry of the Cl–M–PH monomer was optimised for each of the methods employed, and the structural data are collected in Table 2, together with those from previous studies.",3
73,"Although no symmetry constraints were applied, the Cl–M–P angle optimised to very close to 180° in all cases.",8
74,"It may be seen that there is very little variation in the P–H distances and H–P–M angles, maximum differences being 3 pm and 2° across all of the molecules and methods.",8
75,"By contrast, there is much greater variation in the M–Cl and M–P distances.",8
76,"For Cu and Ag, the HF values are significantly larger than those obtained from the correlated methods, although this difference diminishes as the metal becomes heavier.",8
77,"Among our data, MP2 gives the shortest M–Cl and M–P distances for all metals, the bond lengths increasing in the order MP2 < QCISD ≤ CCSD.",5
78,"For Cu, Ag and Au at the CCSD(T) level, (P–H) and ∠H–P–M are essentially identical to the CCSD values.",8
79,"This is also the case for the metal–ligand bond lengths in Cl–Au–PH, although slightly larger (0.01–0.02 Å) differences are found for the Ag and Cu systems.",8
80,We were unable to obtain a fully converged CCSD(T) geometry for Cl–[111]–PH.,8
81,Some of the (M–Cl) and (M–P) data are plotted in Fig. 2.,8
82,"The deviation between the non-relativistic QCISD and MP2 values of (M–Cl) and (M–P) and their relativistic counterparts increases very significantly as the metal becomes heavier, with the relativistic bond lengths being much shorter than the non-relativistic. For element 111, the difference between non-relativistic and relativistic ([111]–Cl) is  30 pm, while that for ([111]–P) is as much as 60 pm.",5
83,"The shortening of bond lengths upon the inclusion of relativistic effects is well established, though the differential effect of relativity on (M–Cl) and (M–P) in the present calculations deserves comment.",1
84,There is a striking difference between the trends in relativistic (M–Cl) and (M–P) for the heavier metals.,8
85,For both (M–Cl) and (M–P) there is a significant increase from Cu to Ag (c.,5
86,20 pm).,5
87,"For (M–Cl), changing from Ag to Au and [111] produces almost no difference.",8
88,"By contrast, there is a marked contraction in (M–P) from Ag to [111], by c.",5
89,"10–15 pm, depending on the computational method.",5
90,"This difference between the trends in (M–Cl) and (M–P) has been noted and studied previously by Bowmaker  for M = Ag and Au, and these workers put forward two possible explanations.",1
91,"The first, based on earlier work by Schwerdtfeger , centres on the role of the metal’s valence s atomic orbital.",1
92,"The direct relativistic contraction of valence s and, to a lesser extent, p atomic orbitals is well documented (although its source is often misunderstood).",1
93,"The relativistic bond length contraction in Cl–M–PH, the argument goes, will be larger when there is appreciable s character to the bonding.",1
94,"Thus for a completely ionic MX bond, there will be no s character and hence no relativistic contraction (indeed, there might be a slight  in the bond length, on account of the indirect relativistic expansion of the valence d orbitals).",1
95,"The contraction will progressively increase, for a given metal, from MX through M–X to MX, as the population of the M s increases from formally 0 to 2.",1
96,"As can be seen from the Mulliken charges given in Table 3, the M–Cl bond is certainly more ionic in the ClM sense than is the M–P (as expected given the relative electronegativity of Cl and P).",8
97,"Thus the (M–Cl) contraction should be less than that of (M–P), as is indeed observed.",8
98,"The problem with this argument, as indeed was noted by Bowmaker , is that the relativistic contraction of atomic orbitals and bond lengths have been shown to be two parallel but largely independent effects.",1
99,It is now more than 20 years since evidence was presented to suggest that relativistic bond length contractions are due to reduction of the kinetic repulsion between two atoms; the effect is seen even when non-relativistic atomic orbitals are employed in conjunction with a relativistic Hamiltonian.,1
100,"In the light of this argument, it is difficult to feel entirely comfortable with the s explanation, notwithstanding that it accounts for the observed bond length variations.",1
101,"A second explanation, also put forward by Bowmaker , involves changes in M–P backbonding.",1
102,"Relativistic effects destabilise valence d orbitals, and thus should enhance π back-donation from the M d orbitals to the PH group, strengthening (and presumably shortening) the M–P bond.",1
103,"As shown in Table 4, the relativistic destabilisation of the [111] 6d atomic orbitals is larger than that of the 5d in Au, and hence it might be expected that π back-donation would be largest in Cl–[111]–PH.",8
104,Table 4 also gives non-relativistic and relativistic metal d populations in Cl–M–PH.,8
105,"The relativistic values for Cu and Ag, and the non-relativistic values for Au and [111], are very close to 4.0 for all methods, suggesting very little π back-donation in these cases.",4
106,"By contrast, the relativistic values for Au, and particularly [111], are significantly smaller than the non-relativistic, by  0.25 e in the [111] calculations.",5
107,"This suggests that there may be well be some π back-donation in Cl–Au–PH, with an increased effect in Cl–[111]–PH.",4
108,"As with the first explanation, the computational data lend weight to the π backbonding argument.",4
109,"However, a significant relativistic bond length contraction has been found previously in [111]H, in which there cannot be any metal-ligand π effects.",1
110,"This would suggest that enhanced π back-donation is unlikely to be the sole source of the relativistic M–P bond length contractions in Cl–Au–PH and Cl–[111]–PH, although it may have a role.",4
111,"Perhaps one needs to look no further than the original paper of Ziegler  These workers found that the relativistic bond length contraction decreased in the order Au > AuH > AuCl, and noted “the smallness of relativistic effects in AuCl compared to Au and AuH, is probably due to the fact that this compound is much more ionic than the other two, so that the valence orbitals are largely concentrated on the Cl centre, where relativistic effects are substantially smaller than on Au”.",1
112,"When studying metallophilicity in [X–M–PR], it has become traditional to adopt the following procedure.",1
113,The geometry of the monomer is first optimised using the favoured method (usually MP2 or B3LYP).,3
114,"Subsequently, a series of single point calculations is performed on a dimeric system in which each monomer is held fixed at its previously optimised geometry.",3
115,"The two monomers are oriented at a P–M–M–P dihedral angle of 90°, as shown in Fig. 1a and discussed in the Introduction, and (M–M) is varied.",3
116,"At each value of (M–M), a counterpoise corrected single point calculation is performed, and the results used to generate a metallophilic interaction energy curve.",3
117,"We have also adopted this procedure, and the results are discussed below in section B(ii).",1
118,"Before addressing these data, however, it is worth taking a moment to emphasise that this 90° orientation is not the most stable structure for these compounds.",1
119,"The 90° orientation is chosen so as to minimise the dipolar interactions between the monomers, and if the restriction to P–M–M–P = 90° is lifted, the molecules relax to an orientation in which this angle tends to 180°, as shown in Fig. 1b.",1
120,"Table 5 contains the (M–M), P–M–M–P and interaction energy data for [Cl–M–PH] (M = Cu, Ag, Au, [111]), optimised solely within the constraint of C symmetry.",8
121,"Comparison of Table 5 with Table 6 (which contains analogous data for the systems restricted to 90°) reveals that in all cases the relaxation of the 90° restriction produces larger P–M–M–P, significantly bigger interaction energies and, in almost all cases, smaller (M–M).",5
122,"This illustrates the need for the 90° restriction when studying metallophilicity in these systems; without it, the dipolar interactions dominate.",4
123,"It should also be noted that, for Cu and Ag, even the Fig. 1b structure is not the most stable.",1
124,For these metals the most stable structure is that shown schematically in Fig. 1c.,8
125,We calculate this Cl-bridged structure to be 69 (61) and 84 (50) kJ mol more stable than 1b for Cu and Ag respectively at the MP2 (B3LYP) level.,5
126,"By contrast, we could not locate an analogous structure using relativistic methods for Au and [111].",8
127,Structure 1c has been studied previously for the group 11 metals.,1
128,"El-Bahraoui  conducted a topological analysis of () in [Cl–Cu–PH], and concluded that there is no clear Cu⋯Cu interaction in this structure, on the basis of the absence of a bond critical point between the metal atoms.",1
129,"Liu  noted that 1b is the favoured structure for [Cl–Cu–NH] on account of significant intramolecular H-bonding, but that replacement of NH by PH reduces the H-bonding to the point at which 1c becomes the most stable geometry.",1
130,"Very recently Schwerdtfeger  located structure 1c for non-relativistic gold, (relativistic gold optimised to structure 1b, as in our calculations).",1
131,"These workers also report that structure 1c was located for Cu and Ag, and note that, for [X–M–PR] (M = Cu, Ag, Au) “the gold compounds seem to polymerise with linear [X–M–PR] chains at a P–Au–Au–P torsion angle of 90° thus maximising the aurophilic interaction, while the corresponding copper and silver compounds oligomerise with PR ligands attached to MX units with bridging ligands X such as Cl or Br”.",1
132,"In this context, the size of the R group in [X–Au–PR] clearly influences the relative stabilities of structures 1a and 1b; large R favour 1a and optimum metallophilicity.",4
133,We now turn to our calculations in which the P–M–M–P dihedral angles are fixed to 90° (structure 1a).,6
134,"The (M–M) and interaction energies () are collected in Table 6, together with data from previous MP2 studies, and some of these data are also shown in Fig. 3.",8
135,"In all cases bar [Cl–[111]–PH] at the CCSD(T) level, our basis α (see Computational Details) results are obtained from calculations in which the method used to calculate  is the same as that used to optimise the geometry of the monomer.",6
136,"As it proved impossible to fully converge the geometry of Cl–[111]–PH at the CCSD(T) level, we have used the CCSD monomer geometry to obtain the CCSD(T) (M–M) and  data for [Cl–[111]–PH].",6
137,"We believe that very little error will be introduced by this approach, given the almost identical CCSD and CCSD(T) geometries of the Cu, Ag and Au monomers (Table 2).",6
138,Table 6 reveals that there is effectively no metallophilic interaction at the HF level.,8
139,"This is well known, and was first pointed out by Pyykkö more than a decade ago.",1
140,"The inclusion of electron correlation through the use of post-HF techniques, however, changes the picture markedly, with very significant decreases in (M–M) and concomitant increases in .",5
141,"As is best illustrated by Fig. 3a, there is a general trend to increasing (M–M) as group 11 is descended.",8
142,"Among the post-HF methods, the MP2 approach produces the shortest (M–M) in all cases bar Cu (for which the CCSD(T) value is smallest).",8
143,"The QCISD and CCSD data are very similar to one another, which is not surprising given the methodological similarities, with the CCSD(T) values being slightly shorter than the QCISD and CCSD for a given metal.",8
144,"The MP2 and LMP2 values of Magnko . are smaller than our  data, probably as a result of the use of bigger basis sets in these calculations.",8
145,"Although the trend in the MP2 (M–M) values from Cu → [111] is broadly similar to the QCISD and coupled cluster data, the increase in MP2 (M–M) with increasing metal atomic number is not as pronounced.",5
146,"Thus, while the (Ag–Ag) values for MP2 and CCSD differ by 0.14 Å, the difference in the corresponding ([111]–[111]) data is 0.5 Å.",5
147,The difference between the MP2 and the other post-HF methods is even more noticeable in  (Fig. 3b).,8
148,"Our basis α MP2 calculations predict an almost uniform increase in  from [Cl–Cu–PH] to the transactinide system, from –13.5 to –32.0 kJ mol.",5
149,"The trend in the MP2 and LMP2 data of Magnko  for Cu, Ag and Au is similar.",8
150,"However, the trend in the QCISD and coupled cluster  values is quite different.",8
151,"There is a small increase in  from Cu → Ag, but then there is a decrease from Ag → [111].",8
152,for [Cl–Cu–PH] at the MP2 and CCSD(T) levels is very similar (–13.5  –15.3 kJ mol) but for the transactinide system the MP2 value is three times the CCSD(T).,5
153,The discrepancy between the MP2 and the other post-HF data is significant for two reasons.,4
154,"First, as we are seeking information about the trend in metallophilicity as group 11 is descended, it is of concern that the conclusion from the MP2 data is exactly the opposite to that from the QCISD and coupled cluster approaches, at least as far as  is concerned.",0
155,QCISD and coupled cluster theory predict that  decreases from Ag → [111] whereas MP2 predicts the reverse.,4
156,"Second, the vast majority of the previous work in this area has been done using variants of the MP2 approach,  using the method which, using basis α at least, is inconsistent with the other post-HF techniques.",1
157,"In order to determine the extent to which the discrepancy in the basis α  trend between MP2 and the other post-HF techniques is a consequence of the different geometries obtained by the different methods, we have calculated the MP2, CCSD and CCSD(T)  values at the QCISD minimum energy structures.",3
158,"The results are shown in Fig. 4, together with the QCISD data for comparison.",8
159,"It can be seen that there is little difference between the QCISD//QCISD and the CCSD//QCISD  data, which is not surprising given the similarities between the methods noted earlier.",8
160,"The CCSD(T)//QCISD  values for Au and [111] are also quite similar to the CCSD(T)//CCSD(T) ones in Fig. 3b, the values being slightly less negative at the QCISD geometries, as expected.",8
161,The MP2//QCISD  value for [Cl–Cu–PH] is very similar to the MP2//MP2.,8
162,"For [Cl–M–PH] (M = Ag, Au and [111]), the MP2//QCISD  values are less negative than the MP2//MP2 by several kJ mol, but the general trend in the MP2//QCISD data is the same as that for the MP2//MP2,  the metallophilic interaction increases down group 11.",5
163,This is once again at odds with the other post-HF techniques.,1
164,"In order to probe the extent to which our conclusions are dependent upon basis set size, we have conducted additional MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations using larger basis sets (β and γ, see Computational Details).",6
165,"As geometry optimisations would be prohibitively costly using these bigger basis sets, we have confined ourselves to single point calculations at the basis α geometries.",6
166,"For Cu, Ag and Au, the basis γ MP2  values are 3–4 kJ mol more negative than the basis α data,  the trend to larger  with increasing atomic number persists at this level of theory.",4
167,"Unlike our basis α data, however, the value of basis γ  for the [111] compound is essentially the same as for Au,  the trend to increasing  as the metal becomes heavier is interrupted at [111] for the larger basis set.",4
168,"By contrast to the MP2 data, the CCSD(T) single points using the larger basis sets do not change the trend in  as group 11 is descended.",5
169,"There remains an increase in  from Cu → Ag for both bases β and γ, followed by a slight reduction to Au.",8
170,This reduction continues to [Cl–[111]–PH] at basis β.,8
171,So does the metallophilic interaction energy increase or decrease down group 11?,1
172,MP2 is generally regarded as the least accurate of the post-HF techniques we have used.,1
173,"Indeed, for a system which is well defined by a single reference wavefunction, the CCSD(T) approach should be close to the full CI limit for the basis set employed.",1
174,"The  diagnostic values for the CCSD(T)/basis α calculations at the maximum  structures are 0.030, 0.017, 0.017 and 0.014 respectively for the Cu, Ag, Au and [111] dimers.",5
175,"The limit above which there may be appreciable multi-reference character to the wavefunction is generally taken to be 0.02, so we can see that with the exception of the Cu dimer, all of our systems are below this limit (perhaps the Cu dimer breaks the  trend from [111] → Au → Ag because it may not be as well-defined by a single reference).",5
176,"This suggests that the Ag, Au and [111] coupled cluster data should be reliable, and we are therefore inclined to conclude that the strength of the metallophilic interaction decreases from [Cl–Ag–PH] to [Cl–[111]–PH].",4
177,"As noted in the introduction, van der Waals-like interactions cannot reliably be described by current density functional approaches; indeed, Pyykkö writes that “the dispersion-type,  terms resulting from the dipole-dipole Hamiltonian in second order, are not explicitly included in the derivation of DFT”.",1
178,"Nevertheless, out of curiosity we have studied structure 1a using two of the most common DFT approaches, the pure DFT BP86 method and the hybrid B3LYP variant.",3
179,"The calculation of (M–M) and  was done in the same way as for the  calculations described above, and the results are given in Table 6 and Fig. 3.",8
180,"We do not wish to dwell overly on these data, but note that the DFT values are not significantly out of step with the  results.",8
181,"The BP86 calculations produce a negative interaction energy between the two [Cl–M–PH] monomers in all cases, the value of which decreases down group 11, as is the case for all of the post-HF methods bar MP2.",8
182,"B3LYP produces smaller  values than any of the other methods, but the lack of a converged structure for the transactinide dimer precludes any conclusions as to the trend in  down group 11.",8
183,"It would therefore appear that DFT can reproduce metallophilic interactions, at least in the present systems, although the reasons why are not clear.",4
184,"In this contribution we have reported the results of  and density functional calculations of Cl–M–PH (M = Cu, Ag, Au, [111]) monomers and dimers.",9
185,The key conclusions may be summarised as follows.,1
186,For the monomers there is an increase in (M–Cl) and (M–P) between M = Cu and Ag.,4
187,"As M changes to Au and [111], (M–Cl) remains essentially constant while (M–P) decreases significantly.",4
188,"Evidence is found to support previous explanations based on (a) metal s populations and (b) M → P π backdonation, but we cannot state categorically which, if either, explanation is correct.",4
189,"The effects of relativity on (M–Cl) and (M–P) for the heavier group 11 elements are very significant, 30 and 60 pm respectively for M = [111] (the relativistic bonds being the shorter).",4
190,"For the dimers, the most stable structure for M = Cu and Ag is that shown schematically in Fig. 1c.",8
191,"For M = Au and [111], structure 1b is the most stable.",8
192,"Notwithstanding these observations we, like many previous workers, have analysed the metallophilic interactions between the two monomers oriented as in structure 1a.",9
193,"In agreement with previous results, we find that there is essentially no metallophilic interaction at the Hartree–Fock level.",4
194,"The inclusion of electron correlation at the MP2 level generates significant metallophilicity, which increases steadily down group 11 from –13.5 kJ mol for [Cl–Cu–PH] to –32 kJ mol for [Cl–[111]–PH] at the basis α level.",5
195,This trend has also been found previously from MP2 calculations.,5
196,"By contrast, including electron correlation through the QCISD and coupled cluster approaches changes the trend in metallophilic interaction down group 11.",8
197,"QCISD, CCSD and CCSD(T) calculations all suggest that [Cl–Ag–PH] has the strongest metallophilic attraction, and that the interaction weakens from Ag → Au → [111] ( from –16.7 kJ mol in [Cl–Ag–PH] to –11.2 kJ mol in [Cl–[111]–PH] at the CCSD(T)/basis α level).",4
198,Increasing the size of the basis set does not qualitatively change the CCSD(T) results.,4
199,"We conclude that metallophilicity is weaker in [Cl–[111]–PH] than in any of the lighter group 11 analogues, and suggest that MP2 may not be the most appropriate technique for the study of this effect.",4
0,Self-aggregation and phase separation of a styryl dye in monolayer at the liquid–air interface and in Langmuir–Blodgett films,9
1,"The styryl dye 4-[2-[6-(dioctylamino)-2-naphthalenyl]ethenyl]-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-pyridinium inner salt, (Di-8-ANEPPS), was incorporated in mixed Langmuir, (L), monolayers with the cationic surfactant, octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, (OTMA).",3
2,The stability of the monolayers was found to vary with the surface pressure and the amount of the diluent in the mixtures.,8
3,"The organization of the dye at the interface, deduced from surface pressure–area, –, and surface potential–area, Δ–, isotherms, is compared with the spectroscopic data in Langmuir and Langmuir–Blodgett, (LB), films.",9
4,UV–visible absorption spectra of the pure dye and of the mixtures in L and LB monolayers show the formation of aggregates or domains of Di-8-ANEPPS within the matrix at high amphiphile content.,5
5,"On the contrary, successful transfer of the monomeric form of the dye was achieved using small molar fraction of the cationic matrix.",5
6,The investigation of new amphiphilic fluorescent molecules has gained attention due to their interesting electric and optical properties.,1
7,In this regard the application of molecular assembly techniques has proven to be an excellent alternative to casting and evaporation methods in preparation of ultra-thin films.,3
8,"In particular, Langmuir, (L), monolayers have been widely used as mimetic systems to investigate the self-organization and the nature of the intermolecular interactions, either at the air–water interface or in films transferred onto solid supports by the Langmuir–Blodgett, (LB), technique.",3
9,"The present paper reports the spectroscopic characterization of a styryl dye, (Di-8-ANEPPS), embedded in a diluent matrix of a cationic surfactant, (OTMA), in L and LB films.",9
10,"Like other styryl dyes, Di-8-ANEPPS molecules exhibit a strong tendency to aggregate in monolayer and in multilayer systems.",1
11,"Moreover, these dye molecules are known to respond to changes in the surrounding medium by modifying their electronic properties.",1
12,"The film-forming features of the mixed monolayers were evaluated by means of surface pressure–area, –, and surface potential–area, Δ–, isotherms.",3

20,"– isotherms were obtained with a Lauda Filmwaage FW2 (Lauda, Germany) by discontinuous compression; the compression rate was about 8 Å molecule min; three  values were recorded for each surface area with a time interval of 30 s between the measurements.",10
21,Thirty minutes were allowed for solvent evaporation and monolayer equilibration at the interface prior to compression.,10
22,All the spreading isotherms shown in this paper are the average of at least two curves and were obtained at 20 °C using a Haake thermostat with a water circulation bath.,10
23,Δ– measurements were obtained with the method of the ionising electrode by using Am electrodes with an apparatus assembled in the Department of Chemistry (Florence) and previously described.,3
24,"The accuracy of π is ±0.1 mN m, of A is ±0.5 Å molecule and of Δ is ±10 mV.",6

27,"After relaxation, Langmuir films of Di-8-ANEPPS/OTMA mixtures were transferred onto quartz slides with an upstroke rate of 12 mm min and a downstroke rate of 1–2 mm min.",10
28,The transfer ratio obtained is 1.0 ± 0.1 in all cases.,10
29,UV–visible absorption spectra were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 spectrophotometer.,3
30,"The absorption spectra at the liquid–air interface, at constant areas, were obtained using a Y-shaped fibre optic system connected to the light source and to the photodetector.",10
31,"The light beam passes through the monolayer and it is reflected  a ‘hard coated’ mirror, placed just below the aqueous surface.",10
32,"The fluorescent spectra of the LB films were measured with a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer, using a homemade slide holder especially designed to orient the substrates at 30° and at 60° in the excitation and in the emission mode, respectively.",3
33,"Semi-empirical calculations were run using the software HyperChem 5.1 (HyperCube, USA).",3
34,Fig. 1 shows – and Δ– isotherms for the monolayers of Di-8-ANEPPS and OTMA and their mixture on citrate buffer (pH 3.70).,8
35,"The use of buffer solution, instead of pure water subphase, is required in order to avoid the complete dissolution of the lipidic matrix into the bulk phase.",3
36,"In Table 1 we report the main parameters extracted from the isotherms,  the limiting molecular area , the collapse surface pressure , the maximum surface compressibility modulus −1s and the maximum surface potential value, Δ.",8
37,"is determined extrapolating the linear portion of the isotherm to zero surface pressure,  corresponds to the maximum change of slope of the – isotherms and −1s is defined as: The surface pressure–area profile of the dye monolayer on buffer solution shows a liquid-expanded behaviour, as confirmed by the low surface compressibility modulus value (−1s = 44 mN m), with a limiting molecular area of 51 Å molecule and a collapse surface pressure of 39 mN m (see Table 1).",5
38,Surface potential values follow a linear increase with increasing surface density of the monolayer with a maximum Δ = 509 mV.,5
39,From the analysis of the spreading isotherm it is possible to estimate the orientation of Di-8-ANEPPS molecules at the interface.,1
40,"The experimental surface potential, Δ, for uncharged or un-ionisable substances, is correlated to the vertical component of the dipole moment, , of the amphiphile forming the monolayer by the relation: where  is the intrinsic dipole moment of the molecule,  is its vertical component and  is the angle between the dipole moment vector and the normal to the interface,  is the molecular area and  and  are the relative dielectric constant and the permittivity of the free space, respectively.",6
41,"The dipole moment, , of a molecule can be calculated with respect to the centre of mass of the molecule using the following equation:where  is the charge of the nuclear core,  is the distance between the origin and nucleus  and  is the distance between the origin and electron .",6
42,On the basis of previous works on analogous compounds in solution we considered two possible conformations of Di-8-ANEPPS (see Fig. 2) differing only for the position of the polar head group.,9
43,"We computed the dipole moment for both conformations obtaining || = 33.9 D in case A, and || = 27.2 D in case B where the polar head group is rotated out-of-plane.",5
44,"In both calculations the dipole moment vector is directed along the S–N bond, in Fig. 2 we also report the inertial axes and the dipole moment vectors computed with respect to the centre of mass of the molecule.",5
45,"Application of eqn. (2) to the dye monolayer at maximum packing provided an angle  = 89.5° between  and the normal to the interface for conformation A. In the case of conformation B, we obtained  = 89.3°.",5
46,Fig. 2 shows the molecules oriented according to these tilt angles: for conformation A the entire molecule would lies almost parallel to the water–air interface whereas for conformation B the polar group of the dye resides on the aqueous surface whereas the chromophoric moiety and the alkyl chains point towards the air phase.,5
47,"Conformation A was excluded on the basis of the molecular areas at maximum packing observed experimentally (see Table 1): in fact for conformation A depicted in Fig. 2 we would obtain a cross section of 360 Å, a value exceedingly larger than the experimentally observed .",4
48,"On the contrary, the cross-section obtained for case B is 70 Å a value of the same order of magnitude of the experimental one, therefore we selected the latter conformation as more likely to occur at water–air interface.",4
49,"This choice is also supported by NMR and polarized fluorescence studies of styryl dyes in a lipid membranes, where a perpendicular orientation of the molecule with respect to the interfacial plane is observed.",3
50,"In the case of Di-8-ANEPPS/OTMA mixtures, – profiles indicate monolayers in a liquid-expanded phase, as confirmed by the low surface compressibility modulus values (40–50 mN m).",8
51,"Moreover, Δ– curves are shifted towards surface potential values larger than in the case of the pure dye although the profile of the isotherms remains very similar.",8
52,We obtain additional information on the interaction of the dye with the lipidic matrix analysing the variation of mean molecular areas and of surface potential values at constant surface pressure as a function of the molar fraction of the dye.,6
53,"The data are reported in Fig. 3a and in Fig. 3b, respectively.",8
54,The mean molecular areas and Δ values are higher than those calculated for ideal mixed monolayers except in the case of the equimolar ratio.,5
55,"In the case of mean molecular areas, the displacement is higher at lower surface pressures, while the surface potential data follow the opposite trend.",5
56,These results indicate that the Di-8-ANEPPS and OTMA molecules give non-ideal mixtures with repulsive interactions with the exception of the equimolar mixture where an ideal miscibility or a complete immiscibility is inferred.,4
57,"Unfortunately, the difference in  between the two components is too small to draw any exhaustive conclusion on this point.",4
58,We checked the stability of mixed Di-8-ANEPPS/OTMA Langmuir films by monolayer relaxation studies (see Fig. 4) recording the area loss at constant surface pressure.,9
59,The picture shows the results obtained at  = 15 mN m for Di-8-ANEPPS/OTMA mixtures of different composition.,8
60,We observed that the relative decrease in / is more pronounced in the presence of OTMA molecules.,8
61,"The analysis of the results indicates a partial desorption/dissolution process of the monolayer into the subphase, further studies are in progress to define the mechanism of this phenomenon.",5
62,We acquired the absorption spectra of the dye molecules at the subphase–air interface in order to evaluate the influence of the lipidic matrix on the electronic properties of the dye.,0
63,"As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the spectrum of the pure Di-8-ANEPPS, recorded immediately following the deposition of the dye on the surface (105 Å molecule), is similar to the solution spectrum in methanol.",8
64,"The low energy band centred at 500 nm in solution, corresponding to the π–π* transition over the entire chromophore, is shifted to 484 nm at the subphase–air interface, while the band at 322 nm arising from the isolated transition on the pyridinium and naphthyl moieties is slightly visible.",8
65,"It is interesting to note that, 30 min after spreading, the low energy band completely disappears and a new band centred at 348 nm emerges.",8
66,"The latter transition could be ascribed to the formation of H-aggregates at the interface, as previously reported by other authors for similar compounds.",5
67,After 60 min no more changes were observed in the absorption spectrum; the monolayer was further compressed to higher dye surface density and absorption spectra again acquired.,8
68,"Surprisingly no changes were evidenced, either in the position of the bands or in the maximum absorbance values.",8
69,"This indicates that the dye remains in the aggregated domains as the packing of the monolayer increases; the constancy of absorbance is ascribed to the relaxation phenomena at the liquid–air interface, previously described, that causes an overall loss of the chromophore from the monolayer towards the bulk phase.",4
70,"In the case of the mixed monolayers, the time required for the π–π* transition to vanish increases slightly with increasing molar fraction of Di-8-ANEPPS.",5
71,Fig. 5b shows typical absorption spectra acquired after the equilibration time at low surface density for some of the Di-8-ANEPPS/OTMA mixed monolayers examined; the corresponding absorption maxima are reported in Table 2.,8
72,In the same table we also report the ratio between absorbance maxima of the monomer (Abs;  = 465 nm) and aggregate (Abs;  = 348 nm); the data show that in the case of the 4∶1 mixture the ratio is in favour of the monomer form.,5
73,"For  ≤ 0.5 the absorption spectra show always a band between 320 and 370 nm, which could be ascribed to the convolution of the monomer and aggregate transitions.",5
74,"On the contrary, in the case of 4∶1 Di-8-ANEPPS/OTMA monolayers, no aggregate formation is evidenced in the spectrum and the low energy band is shifted to lower wavelengths (see Table 2) with respect to the monomeric form in methanol.",5
75,"Interestingly, the monomer absorption band in the spectrum recorded immediately after monolayer spreading was centred around  = 465 nm, a value similar to the pure dye monolayer and only slightly smaller than  in methanol.",5
76,We recall that the monomer absorption in chloroform was observed at  = 550 nm.,1
77,The shift in the monomer band position might be correlated to a more polar microenvironment sensed by the chromophore in the mixture; this would imply a deeper penetration of the chromophoric part in the water sublayer at the interface.,4
78,"We successfully transferred monolayers of the 1∶4, 1∶1 and 4∶1 mixtures onto quartz slides in the Y configuration: Figs. 6a and 6b describes the UV–visible absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of 1 LB monolayer of the selected mixtures.",8
79,Absorption spectra are similar to those obtained at the liquid–air interface.,8
80,"In particular, for  ≤ 0.5 the absorption spectra show a band centred at about 350 nm that we already ascribed to the transition of H-aggregate molecules.",5
81,The fluorescence emission spectrum shows a maximum at  = 424 nm.,8
82,"Thus, based on the electronic spectra recorded for the LB films, we deduce that the aggregate structure formed in Langmuir monolayers is transferred unaltered onto the substrate.",4
83,This statement is supported also by fluorescence emission experiments.,4
84,In the case of Di-8-ANEPPS in solution a fluorescence maximum was found at  = 636 nm in chloroform and at  = 610 nm in methanol.,5
85,"Fluorescence emission maximum is found at  = 434 nm in the case of a single LB layer for the mixtures at low Di-8-ANEPPS content ( ≤ 0.5), such displacement in fluorescence maxima is assigned to emission from the H-aggregate in agreement with the previous deductions.",4
86,"On the contrary, in the case of the 4∶1 Di-8-ANEPPS/OTMA LB film, the absorption band shifts to 450 nm, and the fluorescence spectrum shows a maximum at  = 627 nm (see Table 2) confirming the presence of Di-8-ANEPPS monomer.",5
87,This is also clearly evidenced by the computed ratio of the absorbance maxima reported in Table 2.,8
88,The results obtained for the LB films are in good agreement with the L monolayer with the exception of the 1∶4 mixture where a larger uncertainty is expected due to the extremely low Di-8-ANEPPS content.,5
89,"Moreover, comparison with a solvatochromic characterization of Di-8-ANEPPS previously performed indicates that the monomer resides in a rather polar environment also when transferred in the LB film.",1
90,The absorbance of the electronic spectra recorded for the multilayer systems does increase linearly with the number of layers (data not reported): the outcome is in accordance with the absorbance behaviour at the subphase–air interface.,8
91,The above results allowed to propose a hypothesis on the association of the dye in the mixed monolayers.,1
92,"In the case of  ≤ 0.5, OTMA molecules screen the high negative charge density of the dye, allowing the formation of domains of H-aggregates of Di-8-ANEPPS at the interface.",5
93,Such domains can be transferred on solid supports without any modification in the structure of the aggregate.,5
94,In contrast for  > 0.5 the electrostatic repulsion between the dye amphiphiles predominates and hence Di-8-ANEPPS molecules are dispersed in the OTMA matrix mainly in a monomeric form.,5
95,"Surface characterization of the styryl dye Di-8-ANEPPS is achieved by surface pressure–area and surface potential–area isotherms on buffer subphase as a function of increasing molar fraction of a diluent matrix, OTMA.",3
96,"The data indicate the presence of repulsive interactions between the two components, except in the case of the equimolar ratio where a complete immiscibility is supposed.",5
97,The absorption spectra of the pure dye and of the mixtures at the liquid–air interface show the formation of domains of aggregates within the amphiphilic matrix at low dye content.,8
98,"In particular, in the case of  ≤ 0.5, no monomer species are detected in L and in LB films neither by absorbance spectroscopy nor by fluorescence emission.",5
99,"Interestingly, a significant population of Di-8-ANEPPS monomers appears in the absorption and emission electronic spectra of the 4∶1 Di-8-ANEPPS/OTMA monolayer, both at water–air interface and in LB film.",5
100,"In this case, we also observed that the chromophoric part of the dye molecule resides in a rather polar environment.",5
101,"Since the understanding of the energy migration and transfer in such monolayer and LB systems is essential for the rational design and fabrication of chemical devices based on vectorial energy and electron transport, these results on the aggregation behaviour in an organic matrix appear relevant for the fabrication of microelectronic devices.",4
0,Environmental effects on a conical intersection: A model study,9
1,Excited-state processes at conical intersections (CIs) involving charge transfer phenomena can depend sensitively on the influence of a polar and polarizable environment.,1
2,We propose here a formulation to describe the chromophore–environment interaction for such situations.,9
3,"In a model study, we focus on an extension of the two-electron two-orbital model by V. Bonačić-Koutecký, J. Koutecký, and J. Michl [, 1987, , 170], which yields a diabatic model for the S–S CI in protonated Schiff bases and related systems, and describes the charge properties and charge translocation phenomena associated with this CI.",3
4,"The electrostatic effects of the environment, which are expected to strongly affect the CI topology, are accounted for by a dielectric continuum model.",6
5,This translates to the image of free energy surfaces for the coupled chromophore–environment system represented by molecular coordinates plus a solvent coordinate.,8
6,The environment's impact on the location and character of the CI is investigated.,9
7,The limiting situations of “frozen” and equilibrium solvation effects are examined.,0
8,"Conical intersections (CIs), , multidimensional, cone-like topological structures at degeneracies between Born–Oppenheimer surfaces, are known to play a key role in the ultrafast dynamics of photoexcited molecular systems.",1
9,Their great relevance for biochemical and biological systems has been confirmed over the past decades.,1
10,"By their particular topology, CIs act as “photochemical funnels” which effectively and selectively induce transitions between electronic states.",1
11,"While such processes have been extensively studied in gas phase species, the influence of an environment on conical intersections has not yet been systematically investigated.",2
12,"For example, the recent study involving two of us in  is the first explicit investigation of solvent effects on the ground state reaction path near a CI, and the QM/MM type calculational approaches of  provide an avenue to the microscopic description of both ground and excited states in an environment.",1
13,"In the present contribution, we discuss a new approach to modeling the environment's influence on the excited-state processes at a conical intersection.",9
14,"The importance of understanding environmental effects on the processes at and near CIs is highlighted by a number of recent studies of biologically relevant systems, notably the chromophores of the rhodopsin family and other photoactive proteins, porphyrin-quinone complexes, as well as the building blocks of DNA.",2
15,These studies reveal the crucial role of CIs and suggest that a solvent or protein environment has a pronounced impact on the electronic structure and CI topology.,2
16,"Due to the environment, CIs can indeed be substantially displaced, or may even disappear.",1
17,"Given the complexity of these systems, a key step in the theoretical analysis is to select the relevant features which determine the energetics and dynamics of the chromophore–environment supermolecular system.",1
18,"In the present work, we focus on situations where the CI involves a charge transfer process and therefore couples strongly to the environment's electrostatic properties.",9
19,"This is of relevance, in particular, for the S–S CI in protonated Schiff bases (PSBs) like retinal, which plays a key role in the chromophore's – isomerization and can be associated with the translocation of a positive charge.",1
20,"Charge transfer has also been shown to characterize the earliest events in the photoactive yellow protein, PYP, photocycle.",1
21,The theoretical model developed within is designed to capture the electrostatic aspects of the chromophore–environment interaction and is thus specifically adapted to such situations.,9
22,"At the level of description adopted here (which allows for considerable generalization), the model involves (i) a description of the environment as a dielectric continuum (Section 2) which translates to a solvent coordinate picture, previously exploited in models for charge transfer reactions strongly coupled to large amplitude nuclear motion, see , in conjunction with (ii) a representation of the chromophore's electronic structure in a diabatic basis of states which are constructed such as to preserve their charge character in the nonadiabatic coupling region.",6
23,This type of basis is best adapted to formulate the interaction with a polar and polarizable environment.,6
24,"(The term diabatic is here meant in a loose sense, to describe a basis which has “smooth” properties and approximately diagonalizes the nuclear kinetic energy operator.)",6
25,"In this first effort, we focus on a simple realization of such a basis in terms of valence bond (VB) type states suitable for the description of PSBs, as an extension of the two-electron two-orbital model by Bonačić-Koutecký, Koutecký, and Michl (Section 3).",6
26,The description of the environment as a dielectric continuum leads to an augmented electronic structure problem yielding free energies; the latter carry a parametric dependence on the chromophore's internal degrees of freedom plus a solvent coordinate representing the environmental polarization field.,8
27,"The solvent coordinate thus appears as an additional degree of freedom which, for the coupled free energy surfaces at the CI, plays a substantial role in determining the CI topology and the concerted chromophore–environment dynamical path.",8
28,"In the present context, we examine the two extreme cases of a “frozen” solvent  equilibrium solvation situation (Section 4).",9
29,"While the present work focusses on the case of a small chromophore in solution phase, the theoretical framework we are developing is generalizable to take into account the specific nature of the environment, by referring to microscopic solvent coordinate concepts, with emphasis on the environment's heterogeneous character.",1
30,"This opens up an avenue to treat very general types of system–environment situations, in particular (i) complex molecular systems, even gas phase species, characterized by a local site which interacts with an intramolecular “bath” involving charged and polarizable groups, and (ii) large molecules in a solvent environment, where the local site of interest interacts with an effective environment comprising intramolecular and solvent components.",1
31,"For a chromophore embedded in a protein  electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and covalent interactions, the local environment bears features of both cases (i) and (ii).",1
32,The present work maps out the very first steps towards such complex environments.,0
33,The paper is organized as follows.,1
34,Section 2 addresses the general theoretical formulation leading to a free energy surface description of the combined chromophore–environment system.,1
35,Section 3 introduces the extended two-electron two-orbital model we use to describe the coupled S–S states in protonated Schiff bases.,1
36,"In Section 4, we address the charge properties, free energy surfaces, and solvent effects for the CI model.",1
37,Section 5 summarizes some future perspectives and concludes.,1
38,"We adopt a description of the environment  a dielectric continuum model, , the environment is described in terms of a polarization field interacting with the electric field created by the solute.",6
39,"The polarization field can be represented as the sum of two components, () = () + () where  denotes a field point in the solvent, and the sum refers to an electronic (“fast”) component  associated with the electronic solvent degrees of freedom and an orientational (“slow”) component  associated with the solvent dipoles' reorientation in response to the solute field.",6
40,This latter component determines the  effects in the solvation dynamics: There is no requirement in general that the orientational polarization be in equilibrium with the molecular solute's charge distribution in its dynamical evolution.,6
41,"As detailed in , the interacting solute–solvent system can be characterized  a free-energy functional [, , ].",6
42,"Here, the interaction with the environmental polarization fields is added to the molecular electronic Hamiltonian, thus defining an augmented electronic structure problem.",6
43,"Minimization of  yields solutions which depend parametrically on two types of “slow” variables: the internal nuclear coordinates of the chromophore , and the slow polarization component .",6
44,"These solutions (,) are adiabatic free energies, by analogy with the adiabatic energies of the conventional wavefunction description.",6
45,"Importantly, a nonequilibrium process can be described in terms of the dynamics on such free energy surfaces (,).",6
46,This necessitates the introduction of a kinetic energy for .,6
47,Time scales of nonequilibrium solvation are generally similar to the internal molecular degrees of freedom dynamics: picoseconds to femtoseconds.,6
48,"While the solution to the combined solute–solvent electronic structure problem is non-trivial, and in general necessitates a quantum treatment of the electronic polarization field, we focus here on a particular limiting situation: The solvent electronic polarization adjusts rapidly to the solute's electronic configuration and can therefore be adiabatically eliminated.",3
49,"In electron transfer language, the electronic polarization is fast compared to the transferring electron.",1
50,"This limit is characterized by the condition 2/ℏ ≪ 1 in terms of the electronic coupling , which sets the electron transfer time scale, and the characteristic solvent electronic polarization energy ℏ.",6
51,This condition is applicable to an important class of charge transfer reactions in various solvents.,6
52,"This Born–Oppenheimer (BO) limit leads to the following, simplified, form of the free energy functional[, ] = [,] + [,] + [] + []with the following contributions:",6
53,"(i) the expectation value of the electronic Hamiltonian  of the isolated molecular system, [,] = 〈||〉for the solution phase solute electronic wavefunction (;,) which has a parametric dependence on the nuclear degrees of freedom  and on the orientational polarization field ;",6
54,"(ii) the solute–solvent interaction , , interaction between the polarization  and the solute electric field , [,] = –(1 – 4π–1el)∫ d ·where  = 4π/( – 1), with  the optical dielectric constant;",6
55,"(iii) the electronic polarization contribution , for an electronic polarization  field which instantaneously equilibrates to the solute electric field ,",6
56,"(iv) the orientational self-free energy contribution , with  = 4π(1 +  – )/( – ) where  is the static dielectric constant.",6
57,We note that the free energies resulting from minimizing the functional eqn. (2) can be formulated as the eigenvalues of an effective Hamiltonian.,6
58,"In the above expressions, the electric field  generated by the solute is (; ) = –∇(; ) with the potential produced at point  in the solvent by the solute electronic density (′;).",6
59,"The latter is the single-particle density derived from the electronic wavefunction, (; ) = ∫ d…d (,…,;)*(,…,; )",6
60,"We will focus within on the case where the wavefunction is expressed in a basis of states {(;)}, each of which corresponds to a fixed charge distribution.",6
61,These states are what we term valence bond (VB) states and constitute an appropriate basis for including the interaction with the external polarization fields.,1
62,"The solute charge distribution can thus be written with component densities (,) = ∫ d…d(,…;) × *(,…,;).",6
63,"This partitioning carries over to the potential  = ∑  and to the electric field,  = –∇, such that the solute–solvent interaction takes the form.",6
64,"Thus, components of the interaction free energy can be associated with the field generated by the component solute charge distributions .",6
65,"The orientational polarization also couples to the off-diagonal components  ≠ , corresponding to the “exchange” field components, giving rise to off-diagonal terms in the diabatic representation for the free energy and leading to a diabatic coupling renormalization.",6
66,The interaction free energy partitioning eqn. (10) is taken as a basis to define solvent coordinates associated with each component.,6
67,"To calculate the individual contributions, knowledge of the nonequilibrium polarization field  is required, and necessitates approximations in the absence of a complete representation of the field.",1
68,One useful approach is the representation of  in terms of .,6
69,"In particular, the nonequilibrium polarization can be expressed, in a chemical reaction context, in terms of a single solvent coordinate  which weights the equilibrium contributions in the reactant () and product () states, (;) = (1 – )eqor,(;) + eqor,(;) Here, the off-diagonal components  ≠  of eqn. (10) have been neglected.",6
70,(We will later identify  and  in the CI context).,1
71,"With eqn. (11) for the polarization field, the “Marcus-like” free energy parabolas are obtained, displaced along the solvent coordinate .",6
72,"The free energies of eqn. (12), denoted by a subscript , comprise components in the interaction free energy  of eqn. (4), the electronic solvent free energy  of eqn. (5), and the orientational self free energy  of eqn. (6).",6
73,"The ,eq() are the equilibrium free energies for the  and  states, , the free energies with  equilibrated to the charge distributions in  and , respectively.",6
74,"The “solvent force constant” is () = 0∫[eqor(, ) – eqor, (, )], with 0 = 4π/(1 – /), and is directly related to the reorganization energy () = ()/.2",6
75,"Note that all relevant quantities – in particular, the equilibrium polarization fields, the solvent force constant, and the reorganization energy – carry a dependence on the internal molecular coordinates , due to the solute electric field  dependence on .",1
76,"Conical intersections of charge transfer type, , involving a transition between an ionic and a covalent state, constitute a generic class of conical intersections in polar double bond systems.",1
77,"Among these, as anticipated in the Introduction, protonated Schiff bases (PSBs) may be considered a paradigm example, for which S–S isomerization can proceed  a CI, for both the CC and CN bonds.",1
78,"While the chromophores in question in fact exhibit a complicated electronic structure, with various CIs of different types, notably of one-bond flip (OBF) and hula-twist (HT) type, we focus here exclusively on an OBF mechanism which only involves a twist around the CC double bond, rather than a concerted twist/flip process for several neighboring bonds.",1
79,"The CIs in question occur at a twisted geometry of the double bond – often close to 90° or, according to our model, at exactly 90° – and thus correspond to a biradicaloid structure.",1
80,"The two-electron two-orbital model developed by Bonačić-Koutecký and Michl in the late 80s explains the occurrence of such CIs by a degeneracy, at a biradicaloid geometry, of a covalent (“dot–dot”) and ionic (“hole-pair”) type configuration.",1
81,"A key observation of the model is that the electronegativity difference across the double bond, measured by a parameter , determines whether a CI can actually be found: With increasing values of , the S state is stabilized until an S/S degeneracy is met at a threshold value.",1
82,"The model thus explains that, while no CI is found for twisted ethylene ( = 0), in the absence of asymmetric perturbations as induced, , by pyramidalization, CIs do occur for PSBs.",1
83,"The relevant PSB electronic configurations can be represented in an approximate fashion in a basis of localized p orbitals, which are best adapted to the biradicaloid structure at the twisted geometry.",1
84,"A minimal model for the S–S conical intersection can be formulated in terms of the two singlet states with the notation A ≡ p and B ≡ p for two p orbitals on neighboring carbon centers, and |Σ〉 = (1/√2)(αβ – βα) the singlet spin configuration.",6
85,The |AB〉 state corresponds to the dot–dot configuration mentioned above while the |B〉 state is one of two hole-pair configurations.,6
86,"(The complementary |A〉 configuration is assumed to be shifted to high energies, due to the effect of the asymmetry parameter )",6
87,A detailed description of the model is given in .,1
88,The two configurations eqn. (13) have different locations of the positive excess charge carried by the PSBs.,8
89,"If one thinks of the following partitioning in terms of the left and right hand PSB moieties (see also ), where the vertical bar indicates a cut through the CC double bond, the charge characteristics of the basis states may be described in a short-hand notation,, the positive charge is localized on the nitrogen end for the |AB〉 state and on the hydrocarbon end for the |B〉 state.",1
90,A charge  therefore takes place upon the transition between these two states.,1
91,"The {|AB〉,|B〉} states represent a charge-localized, valence bond (VB) type basis, and provide a simple realization of a more general type of diabatic representation which preserves the basis states' charge character in the nonadiabatic coupling region.",1
92,"At the 90° twisted geometry, the |AB〉 and |B〉 states are uncoupled due to symmetry reasons and describe biradicaloid configurations.",1
93,"Twisting away from  = 90° induces a non-zero overlap and, hence, π-binding effects between the p orbitals on neighboring centers, such that the |AB〉 and |B〉 states are mixed.",1
94,"The twisting coordinate  therefore acts as a , or , coordinate.",1
95,"The solution phase diabatic free energy model we adopt takes the following form, where the coordinate  (associated with CC stretch motion) plays the role of a  coordinate, which only contributes to the diagonal terms and thus modulates the energy gap between the two diabatic states.",6
96,The solvent coordinate  also acts as a tuning coordinate  the diagonal terms in eqn. (16).,6

98,"(We have suppressed the explicit dependence of  on (;,) in the notation).",6
99,The solvent-induced component thus leads to a renormalization of the coupling.,6
100,"Further, at a CI, the solvent-induced coupling can have a symmetry-breaking effect: , a coupling can be induced by the solvent for  = 90° while ( = 90°) = 0 by symmetry for the isolated chromophore.",1
101,"In this case, the CI is shifted away from  = 90°.",1
102,We consider this type of effect no further here.,1
103,The model eqn. (16) should be taken to correspond to the simplest scenario which gives a qualitatively correct picture for the S–S intersection in PSBs.,6
104,Different interpretations are currently given as to whether an effective two-mode model is in fact viable to describe the dynamics in various retinal analogs and other PSBs.,1
105,"While Robb, Olivucci and co-workers indeed supported a two-state-two-mode model in their recent work, Martínez and co-workers provided evidence that, besides the torsion and the CC stretching mode (or a concerted stretching motion across the PSB carbon skeleton), the C–N stretch plays an important role in the branching space of the S–S conical intersection.",1
106,Our model could be extended in view of these findings.,4
107,"The model eqn. (16) is parameterized in an approximate fashion for the internal modes (, ) and solvent coordinate ; Table 1 lists the relevant parameter values.",6
108,"While we do not explicitly make contact with the electronic structure side in the present study, we suggest as a future strategy to fit  data to the model under consideration.",1
109,"The diagonal contributions (,) and (,) in eqn. (16) include (i) a Morse form in the stretch coordinate , (ii) a -dependent shift term which displaces the minimum of the Morse potential for increasing , and (iii) a diagonal angle-dependent term chosen according to the study by Tennyson and Murrell for ethylene.",6

113,"Further, the diagonal contribution in the torsion is given asAB() = ABcoswith AB < 0 such that the diabatic ground-state potential is bonding for  = 0°, see .",6
114,"Similarly, the diagonal potential for the hole-pair state |B〉 reads , with definitions analogous to eqns. (19), (20) and (21), in addition to an energy shift Δ with respect to the |AB〉 state.",6
115,"The coupling between the |AB〉 and |B〉 states is given as () = (1)cos  + (3)cosin accordance with the models developed for ethylene by Domcke, Manthe and co-workers and, for the contribution in cos , by Tennyson and Murrell.",6
116,"The physical origin of the term in cos  is a resonance integral, proportional to the overlap between the p orbitals on the neighboring centers; the third-order term should be understood as a higher-order correction conforming to the required symmetry.",1
117,We restrict the present analysis to the term in cos .,9
118,"Finally, the solvent free energies ABs and correspond to two displaced parabolas in accordance with eqn. (12), with the  equilibrium free energies and force constants , The free energies eqn. (23) are analogous to, , the model developed in  for charged polyenes.",6
119,"An estimate for the solvent force constant  = 2 (here assumed to be independent of the internal coordinates), with  the solvent reorganization energy, can be obtained from the Marcus–Born model where the solute charge distribution is surrounded by a cavity in the dielectric continuum.",6
120,The reorganization energy  is then related to the work required to transfer charges from the reactant to the product cavity.,6
121,"Here, a value of  = 2.5 eV is used, which has been derived for acetonitrile but is also applicable in an approximate fashion to other solvents.",6
122,"The following analysis is based on the two-state, three-mode model of eqn. (16), with the twisting coordinate  as a coupling mode, the CC stretch coordinate  as a tuning mode, and the solvent coordinate  as an additional tuning mode.",3
123,"We will successively address the resulting potential surfaces and their topology for the isolated chromophore (Section 4.1), the associated charge distributions resulting from the mixing of the {|AB〉,|B〉} states and their decoupling at the 90° twisted geometry (Section 4.2), and the inclusion of the solvent (Section 4.3).",9
124,"Fig. 1 shows the coupled S and S surfaces for the isolated chromophore, obtained by diagonalizing the matrix eqn. (16) excluding the solvent contribution.",8
125,"The surfaces feature a CI at  = 90°, which coincides with the minimum of the upper adiabatic surface.",5

127,"The cut illustrates that while the coupling vanishes for  = 90°, the diabatic  adiabatic surfaces increasingly diverge when moving towards the planar geometry.",5
128,Fig. 2b shows a complementary cut for the CC stretch potential at the 90° twisted geometry.,8
129,"We pause to note that while our analysis focuses on the conical intersection region, the work by Robb, Olivucci and co-workers shows that the earliest dynamical events in the isomerization of short-chain retinal analogs (subsequent to the Franck–Condon (FC) excitation to S at planar geometry) involve a pronounced displacement in the skeletal stretching modes.",1
130,"Our perspective relates to the second phase of the dynamical process which predominantly involves a displacement in the torsional coordinate, towards the conical intersection point.",1
131,"In this context, we note that the upper adiabatic surface of our model does not give an accurate representation of the Franck–Condon region: for the retinal analogs studied in , the S surface is bound in the torsional angle for the initial planar geometry.",8
132,"For a complete analysis of the reaction path, crucial for the understanding of the femtosecond to picosecond events, the model Hamiltonian has to be modified to account for this feature.",2
133,"Since the basis functions |AB〉 and |B〉 are associated with fixed charge distributions, the charge properties of the adiabatic states S and S as a function of geometry can be derived from an eigenvector decomposition in terms of the VB type components.",1
134,"While the {|AB〉,|B〉} states mix substantially for geometries away from  = 90°, they decouple at the conical intersection.",1
135,"Hence, a pronounced polarization effect is expected when moving towards the conical intersection.",1
136,"This effect is illustrated in Fig. 3, for the isolated chromophore adiabatic surfaces as depicted in Fig. 1.",8
137,"The figure shows the decomposition of the eigenvector corresponding to the S state in terms of its {|AB〉,|B〉} components, as a function of the twist angle  and the tuning coordinate .",8
138,"A step function-like feature is observed for  = 90° along , reflecting that the adiabatic states correspond to different diabatic branches to the left and right of the conical intersection point (see also Fig. 2b).",5
139,"Thus, while the S surface is predominantly of |B〉 character close to the planar geometry, and is entirely |B〉 along the line  = 90°, for  < 0CI, the same surface is of |AB〉 character at and near  = 90°, for  > 0CI.",4
140,"As can be inferred from Fig. 3, the discontinuity is smoothed out away from  = 90°.",8
141,"An entirely complementary picture holds for S, with the roles of the diabatic |AB〉 and |B〉 states exchanged.",8
142,"The S surface is thus predominantly of |AB〉 character, apart from the charge reversal near  = 90° for  > 0CI.",5
143,"The prominent features of the charge distributions of the adiabatic states S and S can be summarized as follows: (i) a “polarization” effect when moving towards  = 90° at a given , as a signature of the |AB〉 and |B〉 state decoupling, and (ii) a sudden charge character change when traversing the CI region along , for values of  near  = 90°.",4
144,This change is step function-like at  = 90°.,4
145,"The above observations in part agree with the picture described by Robb, Olivucci and co-workers and the results obtained by Martínez and co-workers for different retinal analogs.",1
146,"The S and S free energy surfaces derived by diagonalizing the matrix potential eqn. (16) depend on the two tuning modes  and , in addition to the coupling mode .",6
147,"Hence, a  of conical intersections results, , a line in the (,) space for  = 90°, depicted in Fig. 4.",8
148,"The minimum energy CI (MECI) is located at ( = 1.54 Å, = 0.55); the slight departure from the midpoint  = 0.5 can be shown to follow from an analytic analysis.",5
149,(Note also the discussion in  regarding the general tendency towards lowering of the MECI energy upon adding further tuning modes).,1
150,"In the present system, the MECI point in fact represents the global minimum of the S surface.",4
151,"As can further be inferred from Fig. 4, no CI exists for values of  below a certain limiting value, here  < 0.21.",5
152,"As  increases, the intersection point is shifted to smaller  values.",8
153,"The locations (,) along the CI seam are determined by the condition Δ(,  = 90°) = –Δ() for a degeneracy of the two adiabatic states, given a vanishing coupling ( = 90°), with Δ(, ) = (,) – (,) and the solvent-induced free-energy gap The required degeneracy at the CI seam is thus achieved by matching the respective energy gaps induced by the two tuning coordinates  and .",6
154,"According to eqn. (25), the solvent-induced free energy gap Δ() is a linear function of  and vanishes for  = 1/2.",6
155,"The maximum value of Δ() which allows for a CI to occur corresponds to  = 1, for a solvent equilibrated to the |B〉 state.",5

157,"Importantly, the equilibrium CI point does  minimize the S free energy, , the EQCI and MECI points do not coincide.",8
158,"This reflects the particular character of the CI topology, as further detailed below (Section 4.3.3). in connection with an equilibrium solvation perspective.",5
159,"The CI seam plays a key role for the S topology and, hence, the excited-state dynamics.",1
160,The combined dynamical evolution in the internal coordinates and solvent coordinate  will ultimately tend towards the CI seam and the MECI point.,1
161,"In a manner depending on the nonadiabatic dynamics details, this will be followed by a path involving the solvent coordinate on the adiabatic ground state.",1
162,"In general, motion in the solvent coordinate  will be of a -equilibrium character, , the orientational polarization will not be that appropriate to the actual charge distribution in the chromophore as the latter evolves in  and .",1
163,"This necessitates consideration of the full three-dimensional surfaces (,,).",2
164,An approximate dynamical scenario for the nonequilibrium case is addressed in .,1
165,"In the remainder of this section, we focus on the solvent's effect on the chromophore for two limiting situations: (i) a “frozen” solvent polarization (Section 4.3.2). where the solvent coordinate is fixed throughout, imposing a pronounced nonequilibrium solvation situation, and (ii) the case of equilibrium solvation (Section 4.3.3). which implies extremely rapid solvent motion, adiabatically adjusting to the solute charge distribution.",9
166,"Both cases allow for a reduction from the three-dimensional (,,) space to effective free energy surfaces (, ) in  dimensions.",1
167,"For a frozen solvent polarization, determined by a particular value , a single point on the CI seam is selected.",9

169,"Fig. 5 illustrates the adiabatic S and S surfaces as a function of  and , for two cases which represent equilibrium situations for the uncoupled |AB〉 and |B〉 states at  = 90°: (i) a solvent equilibrated to the |AB〉 charge distribution, ABeq = 0 and (ii) a solvent equilibrated to the |B〉 charge distribution.",6
170,"For each fixed  value, a equilibrium solvation situation applies for all geometries away from  = 90°, since the solvent polarization is not allowed to adjust to the actual solute charge distribution.",6
171,"With either condition eqn. (26) or eqn. (27), the solvent-induced free energy gap eqn. (25) takes a fixed value, of Δ(ABeq) = /2 and , respectively.",5
172,"The former does not allow for a degeneracy according to eqn. (24), such that the CI is actually  for  = ABeq = 0.",5
173,"For , a CI does exist, at a value of  = 1.33 Å determined from eqn. (24).",5
174,This point is in fact the EQCI point referred to above.,1
175,"For  = 1, the shift in location of the CI point leads to a change in CI topology from “peaked” for the isolated chromophore to “sloped”, further illustrated by the one-dimensional cut in Fig. 6.",5
176,"In this case, the minimum of the upper adiabatic (S) surface along  no longer coincides with the CI; see also the discussion on the role of CI topology in .",5
177,"The condition of equilibrium solvation identifies the particular points on the free energy surfaces which correspond to a solvent orientational polarization field which is always in equilibrium with the chromophore's charge distribution at each given geometry (, ).",6
178,"These equilibrium points  = (, ) are derived from the free energy condition ∂(, , )/∂ = 0 where the index  corresponds to the adiabatic state in question.",6
179,We focus in the following on the situation where the solvent is equilibrated to the upper adiabatic surface S.,9
180,"For the matrix potential eqn. (16), analytical diagonalization yields an explicit form for the adiabatic surfaces (, , ) and (, , ) and the corresponding eigenvectors.",6
181,"From this follows for the free energy derivative with respect to , for S, with (, , ) the |B〉 component of the S eigenvector.",6
182,"From the minimum free energy condition and eqn. (28), the geometry dependent equilibrium values are thus found as a solution to",6
183,"The case  = 90°, with a vanishing diabatic coupling, represents a particular instance of eqns. (28) and (29).",6
184,"For this angle, eqn. (29) is the equilibrium condition for the diabatic states, (i) for the S branch corresponding to |B〉, for  ≤ , and (ii) ABeq = 0 for the S branch corresponding to |AB〉, for  > .",6
185,"Note that the EQCI point at ( = 1.33 Å,  = 1) is the unique equilibrium point lying on the CI seam.",6
186,"(In general, all points fulfilling the degeneracy condition eqn. (24) for or  = ABeq represent EQCI points; the latter case is excluded in the present system as discussed in Section 4.3.2)..",6
187,"Fig. 7a shows the (, ) dependent solutions of eqn. (29) and illustrates the step function-like behavior , at  = 90°, at the EQCI point.",8
188,"The picture is the analog, for S equilibrium solvation, of Fig. 3a for the isolated chromophore.",8
189,"Detailed comparison of the two figures reveals that the equilibrium solvation case further exhibits a discontinuity in , at  = 90°, along the whole |AB〉 branch of S( > ).",5
190,"This requires further explanation, now given.",1
191,"To understand the origin of the discontinuity, we consider in Fig. 8 a projection of the three-dimensional (, , ) surfaces along , at fixed  = 0CI = 1.59 Å and  = 90° (panel a)  = 90° +  (panel b).",0
192,"While the free energy minimum for the uncoupled case (a) corresponds to the diabatic minimum at ABeq = 0, the adiabatic S minimum in (b) is located at .",8
193,"The limiting value as  approaches 90° is defined by the crossing of the diabatic states, and hence, the point ( = 0CI,  = 0.5) along the CI seam, , .",5
194,"Since this limiting value does  coincide with the equilibrium point ABeq = 0 at  = 90°, a discontinuity arises.",8
195,"A similar observation holds for all  values (within the range of existence of a conical intersection) such that the equilibrium points on the upper adiabatic surface tend towards the  values , Only at the EQCI point does the  value coincide with the true equilibrium value,  = ( = 1.33 Å) = 1.",5
196,Fig. 7b illustrates the limiting behavior eqn. (30).,8
197,"While the overall seam does  conform to an equilibrium condition, its role as a limiting value according to eqn. (30) nonetheless turns out to be crucial for the topology of the free energy surfaces.",4
198,This is illustrated in Fig. 9 for the equilibrium solvation free energies .,8
199,"At  = 90°, the free energies of both states approach the degeneracy at the CI seam, as a result of converging to .",5
200,"Since the S and S surfaces thus tend towards a  of degeneracies, the topology is markedly different from the surfaces of Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 which exhibit a single CI .",5
201,Conditions of equilibrium solvation with respect to S are therefore expected to induce enhanced nonadiabatic transition probabilities to the S ground state as compared with either the isolated chromophore or frozen solvent conditions.,4
202,"We have introduced a theoretical formulation to describe the environment's impact on a conical intersection (CI), which in this first effort has focussed on the environment's influence on the existence, location and character of the CI.",3
203,This formulation describes the interacting chromophore–environment system in situations where electrostatic interactions are dominant such that the environment's orientational polarization field interacts strongly with the chromophore.,5
204,The combined chromophore–environment system is characterized by free energy surfaces in the space of internal molecular coordinates plus one or several solvent coordinate(s).,6
205,A first sketch is given of applying this formulation to the coupled S/S states in protonated Schiff bases.,1
206,The perspective we have developed is based on a free energy model including the solvent as an additional “tuning” mode which modulates the energy gap and displaces the CI.,6
207,"The impact of a solvent can be substantial: For example, if the solvent is equilibrated to a solute state characterized by the charge distribution pertaining to one or the other diabatic state and then frozen, the conical intersection can be entirely lost, or its topology may be altered (here, from “peaked” to “sloped”).",4
208,"For the opposite limit of extremely rapid solvent motion, equilibrium solvation free energies can be defined whose topology is determined by the CI seam: , a  of intersections, rather than a single point in (,) space.",4
209,Pronounced implications for the dynamics are thus expected for the different solvation limits.,7
210,"In addition to these effects, the solvent can also have off-diagonal contributions, solvent-induced couplings, which have a symmetry-breaking effect at the geometries where the coupling intrinsic to the chromophore vanishes.",4
211,A detailed discussion of the PSBs and related systems in the context of the present model will require an  based parameterization including all relevant modes.,1
212,"In addition, the model should be further developed in view of the following aspects: (i) Extension of the free energy picture to molecular level interactions, beyond the dielectric continuum description (This leads to the definition of generalized, microscopic solvent coordinates and paves the way for the application of the present approach to complex environments), (ii) the development of general strategies to define an appropriate diabatic basis representation, chosen such as to exhibit a well-defined charge character, and (iii) a dynamical description including the solvent, leading to the image of a combined dynamical path for the chromophore–environment supermolecular system.",1
213,This necessitates the combination of the nonequilibrium dynamics in the solvent coordinate with the quantum dynamics of the chromophore.,1
214,"Given the above elements, the present approach should contribute to clarifying various aspects of the environment's impact on the subpicosecond and picosecond dynamics in the PSBs.",1
215,"This relates, in particular, to the pronounced differences in the dynamics observed in solution phase as compared with the native protein environment: For the retinal chromophores of rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin, and similarly for the chromophore of the photoactive yellow protein, the decay observed in solution is much slower (of the order of 10 ps) than the decay observed for the native protein (of the order of 200–500 fs).",1
216,"For both the solution phase and protein environments, an interesting comparison will arise from the comparison with QM/MM type approaches as developed, , in .",1

1,A combined  quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulation has been performed to investigate the solvation structure of K in 18.4% aqueous ammonia solution.,9
2,"The chemically most relevant region, the first solvation sphere of K, was treated by Born–Oppenheimer  quantum mechanics using LANL2DZ basis sets, while the rest of the system was described by classical pair potentials.",6
3,"Within the first solvation shell of K, the QM/MM simulation reveals a polyhedral structure with an average coordination number of 7.6, consisting of 6.7 water and 0.9 ammonia molecules, compared to the corresponding value of 8.7 composed of 5.3 water and 3.4 ammonia molecules obtained by classical pair potential simulation.",5
4,"The QM/MM results, in contrast to the classical simulation, clearly indicate a preference for water ligands and a higher flexibility of ligand arrangements in the first solvation shell of the ion.",5
5,The preference for ligands is discussed on the basis of detailed simulation results.,1
6,"In addition, a “structure-breaking” behavior of the ion is well recognized by the detailed analysis on ligand exchange processes and the mean residence times of the ligands surrounding the ion.",5
7,"Since ion solvation processes are of great importance in a wide variety of systems, hydrated ions have become an increasingly important subject of both experimental and theoretical studies.",2

9,"Theoretical methods, in particular Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, can provide valuable complementary information not accessible to experimental approaches both in the characterization of ion–solvent complexes and in the specific mechanism of the involved interactions.",3
10,"During the past decades, numerous MC and MD simulations have been carried out to evaluate hydration structures, hydration energies, mobilities, librational and vibrational spectra and other properties.",1
11,"However, most of the simulation works had relied on classical molecular mechanical potentials, and hence, deviation of the results from experiments was often found, strongly depending on the type and quality of the potential models employed in the simulations.",1
12,"To provide a realistic view of the solvated ion properties, it has been shown that the model interaction potential must include polarizability and many-body nonadditive contributions.",1
13,"With regard to this point, various schemes have been proposed, for example, the polarizable continuum model (PCM), which incorporates the many-body interactions in an average way, or a direct approach by calculating the energy hypersurface of many-body interactions and then fitting them to an analytical function.",3
14,"Both exemplary models can provide significant improvement of the results, however, for the PCM model, a major weakness is that it can not reproduce specific interaction with the surrounding solvent, such as hydrogen bonds.",3
15,"For the second model, construction of many-body potentials is rather difficult, and is hardly feasible for large molecular systems because of their complicated orientation dependence.",1
16,"To describe molecular interactions correctly, more sophisticated simulation technique incorporating quantum mechanical algorithms, namely the combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method has been introduced.",3

20,"By this approach, the complicated many-body contributions as well as the polarization effects within the solvation sphere of the ion can be reliably included.",3
21,"The QM/MM results have clearly shown the important role of non-additive contributions and that inclusion of higher-order interaction terms is essential for the correct description of the solvated ions, even for monovalent ions in which many-body interactions could be expected to be weaker than in the case of di- and trivalent ions.",1
22,"For ion solvation in mixed solvent systems, Born–Oppenheimer  QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations have been successfully applied to Li, Na, Mg and Ca in aqueous ammonia solution.",3
23,The results from QM/MM simulations have provided more reliable geometrical arrangements of the solvated ion structures as well as ligand preferences in good agreement with the qualitative expectation according to Lewis acid–base interactions.,3
24,"In comparison to the results obtained by classical pair potential simulations, the QM/MM simulations have indicated that the pairwise additive potentials, which lack suitable parameterization, are obviously insufficient for the description of the structural properties of solvated ions in such a solvent mixture.",1

29,The solvation structure of K in water and in ammonia has been studied by X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments as well as by theoretical investigations.,1
30,"Experiments reported hydration numbers of K in the range 4–7, while a coordination number of 6 was found in ammonia.",1

33,"Our previous QM/MM simulation has shown that the structure-breaking behavior of this ion is only reproduced, if the first hydration shell is treated quantum mechanically.",1
34,"For the coordination number of K in ammonia, a classical MD simulation reported an average value of 8..7",3

40,Effects of electron correlation may play some role in the interaction between the ion and solvent especially when the number of solvent molecules in the QM region increases.,1
41,"However, treatment at the correlated level is very time-consuming, and thus beyond the current computational feasibility.",1
42,"In our previous QM/MM simulation, these effects were found to be rather marginal even for anion–water interactions, when the stabilization energies obtained by HF single point calculations of the anions plus their first hydration shells for several selected configurations were compared to those of MP2 calculations.",1
43,"In the QM/MM procedure, an  calculation was performed in each simulation step, providing quantum mechanical forces to be incorporated into the total force of the system.",3
44,"Since the exchange of solvent molecules between the QM and MM regions can occur frequently during the simulation, the forces acting on each particle in the system are switched according to the defined region upon entering or leaving of the ligand and can be defined as:  = () + (1 – ()), where  and  are quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical forces, respectively.",6

46,() ensures a continuous change of forces in the transition between QM and MM regions.,6
47,"For interactions inside the MM and between QM and MM regions, flexible models, which describe inter- and intramolecular interactions, were employed for water and ammonia.",3
48,"The use of flexible models is to be favored over any of the popular rigid water and ammonia models, in order to ensure compatibility and a smooth transition, when solvent molecules move from the QM region with their full flexibility of ligand molecules to the MM region.",3
49,The pair potential function for water–ammonia interactions was adopted from Tanabe and Rode.,1
50,"The pair potential function for K–HO interactions was obtained from our previous work, and the pair potential function for K–NH interactions was newly constructed in the present work using DZV+(d,p) basis set for NH and Los Alamos ECP plus DZ basis set for K.",6
51,These basis sets are consistent with the ones used in the construction of the K–HO potential.,1
52,"The 1500 Hartree–Fock interaction energy points for various K–NH configurations, obtained from Gaussian98 calculations, were fitted to the analytical form of where , ,  and  are the fitting parameters (see Table 1),  denotes the distances between K and the -th atom of ammonia and  are the atomic net charges.",3
53,"The charges on K, N and H of ammonia were set to 1.0, –0.8022 and 0.2674, respectively.",6
54,"A classical molecular dynamics simulation using pair potentials was performed first, then a combined QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation starting from the equilibrium configuration obtained by the classical simulation was carried out.",3
55,"For the QM/MM simulation, undoubtedly, the QM region is the most expensive computational part and hence the size of it has to be a compromise between the reliability of results and the available computational resources.",3
56,"In general, the suitable QM size is the sphere including all ligands within the complete first solvation sphere of the ions.",3
57,"A too small size of the QM region can lead to artifacts, which, however, disappear, if the choice of the diameter guarantees that all molecules of the first solvation shell plus eventually exchanging ligands are included in this region.",3
58,"This is always achieved, when the QM limit is set to the beginning or even slightly inside the second solvation shell.",3
59,"In this case, also an increase of width of the transition region does not make any difference for the results.",8
60,"As can be seen from the K–(N + O) radial distribution function (RDF) obtained by the classical simulation (Fig. 1), the first minimum of the RDF peak is located around 3.8 Å.",8
61,"Within this region, there are about 6–8 water and 3–4 ammonia molecules, which seem rather convenient to perform the QM/MM simulation.",3
62,"However, as our previous QM/MM simulation for K in water had predicted a somewhat larger hydration shell compared to the one obtained by classical pair potential simulation, a larger QM region with diameter of 8.4 Å was employed.",3
63,This QM size was assumed to be large enough to ensure a smooth convergence of the quantum mechanical forces to the pair potential forces beyond the QM region.,3
64,"There are about 8–10 water and 3–4 ammonia molecules located within this region, leading to 8–12 min for computing the forces in each QM/MM step on a DEC Alpha XP1000 workstation.",3
65,The classical and combined QM/MM simulations were performed in a canonical ensemble at 293 K. This canonical ensemble has been realized by coupling to an external temperature bath.,6
66,"The time step was set to 0.2 fs, which allows for explicit movement of hydrogen atoms of water and ammonia.",6
67,"The basic cube, with a length of 18.56 Å, contained one K, 37 ammonia and 163 water molecules, assuming the experimental density of 18.4% aqueous ammonia solution at the given temperature (0.9398 g cm).",6
68,The reaction-field method was employed for the treatment of long-range interactions.,3
69,This method also implies a compensation of the electrical non-neutrality of the basic box.,3
70,The classical pair potential simulation started from an equilibrium configuration obtained from our previous QM/MM simulation for Ca in aqueous ammonia solution.,3
71,"The system was equilibrated for 80 000 steps, and the simulation was continued for another 100 000 steps for collecting configurations every 10th step.",3
72,"As the equilibrium configuration of a QM/MM simulation is usually not much different from that of the classically treated system, and differences refer mostly to the small subsystem of the ion and its environment, a time-span of 2–3 ps is sufficient to achieve re-equilibration, even for systems with stronger ion–solvent interactions than the one investigated here, as can be seen from the behavior of velocities and RDFs after that period.",1
73,"The QM/MM simulation started with a re-equilibration for 20 000 simulation steps, followed by another 30 000 steps to collect configurations every 5th step.",3
74,The 6 ps interval of our QM/MM simulation can be considered long enough for structural analysis since it has been shown that even a 2 ps simulation can deliver most of the structural and dynamical properties of similar solutions.,3
75,"The switching function of eqn. (2) was applied within an interval of 0.2 Å (, in eqn. (3),  = 4.0 and  = 4.2 Å).",6
76,Fig. 1 displays and compares the over-all K–(N + O) and K–H (from both water and ammonia molecules) RDFs and their corresponding integration numbers obtained from both classical and combined QM/MM simulations.,8
77,"The classical simulation gives a pronounced first K–(N + O) peak at 2.93 Å, corresponding to an average coordination number of 8.7.",5
78,"The first solvation shell is not clearly separated from the bulk, indicating an interchange of ligand molecules between the first solvation shell of K and bulk.",5
79,"In the QM/MM simulation, a less pronounced unsymmetrical first K–(N + O) peak, with a maximum at shorter distance of 2.79 Å, is observed.",8
80,The shape of the K–(N + O) peak indicates an asymmetry of the K solvation.,5
81,"The first solvation shell of K is also not distinctly separated from the bulk, showing even more frequent ligand interchange at the boundary between the solvation shell and bulk.",5
82,"An integration, calculated up to the first K–(N + O) minimum, yields an average coordination number of 7.6.",5
83,"In both pair potential and QM/MM simulations, a second solvation shell of K is not found, as can be seen from further curves of K–(N + O) RDFs.",8
84,"The ligand compositions of the solvation shell of K can be analyzed by plotting the K–HO and K–NH RDFs and their corresponding integration numbers separately, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.",3
85,"For the K–HO RDFs (Fig. 2), the QM/MM simulation reveals a broader unsymmetrical first K–O peak with maximum at 2.81 Å, compared to the corresponding peak at 2.75 Å of the pair potential simulation.",5
86,The unsymmetrical K–O peak observed in the QM/MM simulation corresponds to weak K–water interactions and a high mobility of water molecules in the solvation shell of K.,5
87,"In addition to the broader K–O peak, a larger and broader K–H(W) peak obtained from the QM/MM simulation (Fig. 2b) supports well a high flexibility and rather freely-oriented arrangements of the water molecules.",8
88,"The average numbers of water molecules in the solvation shell of K are about 5.3 ± 0.2 and 6.7 ± 0.1 for pair potential and QM/MM simulation, respectively.",5
89,"For the K–NH RDFs (Fig. 3), the pair potential simulation produces a sharp first K–N peak with maximum at 2.96 Å, giving an average coordination number of 3.4 ± 0.2.",5
90,"In the QM/MM simulation, a less pronounced unsymmetrical first K–N peak is exhibited at a much shorter K–N distance of 2.77 Å, corresponding to approximately 0.9 ammonia molecules.",5
91,"As in the case of K–O peak, the asymmetrical K–N peak in the QM/MM simulation also indicates a high ammonia mobility, associated with an over-all distorted structure of the solvation shell.",5
92,"Fig. 4 shows the probability distributions of the solvation numbers of K, calculated up to the first minimum of the K–(N + O) RDFs.",8
93,"In the pair potential simulation, the first solvation shell of K prefers a coordination number of 8 (followed by 9 and 7 in decreasing amounts), consisting of 5 (and 6 in decreasing amount) water and 3 (followed by 4 in smaller amount) ammonia molecules.",5
94,"In the QM/MM simulation, the first solvation shell favors a coordination number of 7 (in addition to 8 and 6 in smaller amounts), consisting of 6 (followed by 7, 8 and 5 in smaller amounts) water and one ammonia molecule.",5
95,"As can be seen from Fig. 4, the 8-, 9- and 7-coordinated complexes are mostly dominant in the pair potential simulation, while numerous possible species, varying from 5- to 10-fold coordinated complexes, exist in the QM/MM simulation.",5
96,"In comparison to the statistical average distribution of ligands in the solution of approximately 4.4∶1 for water and ammonia molecules, respectively, the QM/MM simulation obviously indicates a preference for HO with a water-to-ammonia ratio of 7.4∶1.",5
97,"In contrast to the QM/MM results, the corresponding ratio of 1.6∶1 is observed in the pair potential simulation, which reflects a preference for NH.",5
98,"In our previous works, we have shown that the assumption of pairwise additive approximations for the K(HO) and K(NH) complexes had led to energetic errors of approximately 17% and 13%, respectively, for  = 6, and these errors increased rapidly to 32% and 20% for  = 8.",1
99,"Undoubtedly, the many-body contributions can play a significant role for the preferential solvation of the K, and thus the results predicted by classical pairwise additivity are by no means sufficient for a correct description of this ion's solvation in such binary solvent systems.",1
100,"Fig. 5 displays the O–K–O, N–K–N and O–K–N angular distributions, calculated up to the first minimum of the K–(N + O) RDFs.",8
101,"In both classical and combined QM/MM simulations, the solvation shell structure of K is predicted to be approximately polyhedral.",5
102,The rather broad angular distributions indicate the extreme lability and irregular structure of the K solvation.,5
103,"In order to describe the geometrical arrangement of the K solvation, the angle , defined by the K⋯O and K⋯N axes and the dipole vectors of ligands, has been used to investigate the preferential orientations of solvated ligands.",3
104,The dipole-oriented arrangements of water and ammonia molecules within the solvation shell of the ion are given in Figs. 6.,8
105,Both classical and combined QM/MM simulations point out that ammonia ligands stick more rigidly to the dipole-oriented arrangement than water molecules.,5
106,"In the QM/MM simulation, a more flexible arrangement is observed, in particular for water molecules.",8
107,"As can be seen from Fig. 6a, the QM/MM simulation clearly indicates a higher flexibility of the solvated water's orientation, proving the weak structure-forming ability of K even for its nearest water molecules.",5
108,"The higher mobility of the solvated ligands, as observed in the QM/MM simulation, would increase the number and rate of ligand exchange processes.",4
109,"Several ligand exchange processes can be seen when the K–O and K–N distances were separately plotted during the QM/MM simulation, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively.",8
110,"Within the simulation time of 6 ps, 13 water and 3 ammonia molecules were involved in the exchange processes, indicating the extremely fast dynamics of the K solvation.",5
111,"For the exchange of water molecules, both associative and dissociative interchange (defined as  and ) mechanisms are observed.",5
112,"In the case of ammonia molecules, the first exchange, which took place around 2 ps, shows the  mechanism, while the second exchange, which occurred beyond 5 ps, seemingly represents the  type.",5
113,"In order to estimate the rate of ligand exchange processes at K, the mean residence times (MRT) of the ligands were evaluated within the restrictions set by the available period of the QM/MM simulation.",0
114,"Based on a direct accounting and setting the minimum time a ligand has to remain inside/outside a shell upon a migration process as *, the MRT values of 2.1 and 1.9 ps for * = 0.5 and of 15.3 and 5.9 ps for * = 2.0 are obtained for water and ammonia molecules, respectively.",5
115,"The corresponding values for water ligands of hydrated Cs and for pure water are 1.7 and 1.8 ps for * = 0.5, and 10.6 and 13.7 ps for * = 2.0.",1
116,"These data show the particular lability of NH ligands in the first shell of K, but also that the water ligands in this shell have a similar mobility as in pure water.",4
117,"Overall, this represents a well-recognizable structure-breaking effect, although not as pronounced as in the case of Cs.",4
118,The great lability of NH ligands in the neighborhood of K gives some valuable hints at the binding properties of this ion in biological systems involving N-binding sites.,1
119,"In a previous paper, it has been shown that the main reason of K-specific ion channels to transport this ion preferentially to Na is the easy removal of the ion's hydration shell.",1
120,The results presented here indicate in addition that O-binding sites should be considerably more competitive in K binding than N sites.,4
121,The combined  QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation has provided more detailed information on the solvation shell structure of K in 18.4% aqueous ammonia solution.,9
122,The QM/MM simulation has revealed a flexible polyhedral structure with an average coordination number of 7.6.,5
123,"The solvation shell contains approximately 6.7 water and 0.9 ammonia molecules, which reflects a clear preference for water molecules.",5
124,"In addition, the simulation has supplied information on the stability of the K solvate, in particular the “structure-breaking” behavior of the ion and its preference for O-binding sites.",5
125,"The classical simulation based on pairwise additive approximations is apparently not adequate to reproduce well enough the flexible structure and a realistic solvation shell and, therefore, the relevance of n-body and polarization effects, even for weakly interacting ions as K, could be demonstrated once more.",4
0,"Uptake of acetone, 2-butanone, 2,3-butanedione and 2-oxopropanal on a water surface",9
1,"The uptake of acetone, 2-butanone, 2,3-butanedione and 2-oxopropanal on pure water was investigated by means of a single drop experiment.",3
2,This method allows to follow the concentrations in an aqueous drop  by UV-VIS-spectroscopy.,3
3,"Due to Henry's law saturation, the uptake coefficients  decreased with time.",8
4,"Maximum values ( = 293 K) of 1.8 × 10, 1.5 × 10, 8 × 10 and 1.2 × 10 were observed for acetone, 2-butanone, 2,3-butanedione and 2-oxopropanal, respectively.",8
5,"A fit of the experimental data to the resistance model and correction for the effect of gas phase diffusion yield values for the mass accommodation coefficients  = (5.4) × 10,  = (2.1) × 10,  = (1.0 ± 0.3) × 10 and  = (1.5 ± 0.5) × 10.",5
6,A separate model approach is used to discuss the impact of turbulent mixing of the drop.,3
7,"Oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as the ketones being subject of the present study, are either emitted from biogenic and anthropogenic sources or formed as intermediates in the oxidation of atmospheric pollutants.",1
8,"The photolysis of acetone, the most abundant ketone in the atmosphere, in the upper troposphere (UT) may quite efficiently produce HO.",7
9,This channel might even be competitive to HO formation from O(D) + HO under UT conditions.,7
10,"Because of their high solubility, the mentioned gas phase species can be taken up at the surfaces of liquid tropospheric particles, such as cloud droplets or deliquescent aerosol particles.",1
11,It is necessary to know the parameters that govern this process in order to evaluate the rate of transfer and thereby the compounds' budgets in either phase.,2
12,"In the present work, the uptake of acetone, 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone), 2,3-butanedione (biacetyl) and 2-oxopropanal (methylglyoxal), respectively, on water is investigated.",0
13,Key parameters of the uptake process are extracted allowing subsequent modeling of the processes studied here.,0
14,The uptake process is a convolution of different processes.,8
15,"For species that do not show reactions in the liquid phase these are (i) the gas phase diffusion described by the diffusion coefficient , (ii) the actual transfer across the interface which is governed by the mass accommodation coefficient , and (iii) the Henry's law saturation described in terms of 0.5l.",6
16,Here  is the Henry's law coefficient and  is the diffusion coefficient in the liquid phase.,1
17,For convenience  is given here in the frequently used units of mol l atm.,1
18,This can be converted to the SI units mol N m by mol N m = 9.87 × 10 mol l atm.,6
19,", which is the net probability for the uptake of a molecule of the trace gas species that hits the surface, can be expressed according to the so-called resistance model as follows: Here  is the average thermal velocity of the gas phase molecules,  is the gas constant,  is the temperature, and  represents the time the liquid phase is exposed to the gas phase;  accounts for the effect of gas phase diffusion.",6
20,A number of determinations of the Henry's law coefficient of acetone and 2-butanone are reported in literature.,1
21,The -values at 293 K range from 35 to 45 mol l atm (= 0.34–0.45 mol N m) for acetone and from 25 to 27 mol l atm (= 0.25–0.27 mol N m) for 2-butanone.,1
22,"For 2,3-butanone only one -value for 293 K is reported.",1
23,Betterton states 105 mol l atm (= 1.0 mol N m).,1
24,His result for 298 K is about 30% higher than  = 58 mol l atm (= 0.57 mol N m) given by Snider and Dawson.,1
25,The only determination for the Henry's law coefficient of 2-oxopropanal yields  = 5.42 × 10 mol l atm (= 53 mol N m) at 293 K which is very high compared to the other species.,1
26,There is only one single determination of the mass accommodation coefficient for acetone with  = 5.4 × 10 at  = 293 K.,1
27,"For 2-butanone, 2,3-butanedione and 2-oxopropanal no experimental data for  are available.",1
28,"Possibly, because of this lack of data, these species are not included in current chemical multiphase mechanisms despite of their atmospheric importance, see ref.  and references therein.",2
29,In a recent publication by Ervens . a method for the estimation of unknown mass accommodation coefficients was proposed.,1
30,"According to this, estacetone = 3.9 × 10, est2-butanone = 2.1 × 10, est2,3-butanedione = 3.5 × 10 and est2-oxopropanal = 2.9 × 10 are estimated for T = 293 K.",1
31,The uptake experiments were performed in a flow tube reactor (i.d. = 2.13 cm) which includes a section for generation and analysis of a single drop on a pipette’s tip (see Fig. 1).,10
32,Both phases can be analyzed by UV-VIS spectroscopy.,10
33,Details of the setup are described elsewhere.,1
34,"The experiments were done at 293 K in humidified He (>99,999%, Linde) at 10.1 kPa total pressure.",10
35,The total gas flow in the reactor was set to 1.00 × 10 cm min by calibrated mass flow controllers (MKS 1259).,10
36,Gas mixtures of the carrier and the trace gas were prepared in a special mixture apparatus and stored in large flasks.,10
37,Before entering the flow tube  the main inlet a small flow containing the trace gas species was added to the main flow with partial pressures of  = 8.0 kPa and  = 2.1 kPa.,10
38,The pipette for drop generation had an outer diameter of 1.55 mm.,10
39,The radius of the drops was  = 2.2 mm resulting in a gas droplet contact time of  = 2.34 ms.,10
40,The surface area of the drop  is calculated to be 1.67 × 10 m and the liquid volume  was 6.9 × 10 m.,10
41,These values were kept constant for all experiments.,10
42,"All drops were made of pure water (Millipore MilliQ, 18 MΩ cm).",10
43,"Acetone (99.8%, Fluka), 2-butanone (99.5%, Riedel-de Haën) and 2,3-butanedione (99%, Fluka) were used without further purification.",10
44,"The absorption spectra of 1 × 10 mol l solutions measured with a commercial spectrometer (Hewlett Packard, HP 8453) are shown in Fig. 2.",8
45,One band at 265 nm with  = 17.5 l mol cm is featured in the spectrum of acetone.,8
46,2-Butanone has an absorption maximum of  = 20.5 l mol cm at 267 nm.,8
47,These values compare well with literature data.,1
48,"The spectrum of 2,3-butanedione has two bands in the 200–500 nm region.",8
49,The strongest one centered at 284 nm has a maximum absorption coefficient of 26.5 l mol cm.,8
50,No comparable literature data were found.,1
51,"In order to obtain water-free and unpolymerized 2-oxopropanal, the commercially available aqueous solution (40%, Fluka) was processed similarly to the method Schweitzer  used to produce pure glyoxal.",1
52,The normalized spectrum of diluted 40% aqueous solution of 2-oxopropanal is shown in Fig. 3.,8
53,A spectrum of a drop exposed to 2-oxopropanal in the gas phase is also shown.,8
54,Both are qualitatively different.,8
55,Neither the positions of the band and the minima nor the relative absorptions for different wavelengths match.,8
56,This is supposed to be due to oligomerisation in the undiluted stock solution.,7
57,An attempt was made to prepare a solution of the monomer carbonyl by putting the pure substance into water.,10
58,"Although the resulting solution showed a spectrum that was qualitatively the same as that observed in the single drop experiment, it was not possible to quantify the amount of 2-oxopropanal dissolved.",8
59,In all experiments a white precipitation was forming if the pure 2-oxopropanal was about to dissolve in the water indicating no complete dissolution of the substance.,5
60,"Therefore, 2-oxopropanal was dissolved from the gas phase into water using the setup described below.",3
61,Helium was flowed over the water-free substance and subsequently bubbled through a bottle containing water.,10
62,After this the gas phase was analyzed by UV-VIS spectroscopy.,10
63,There was a bypass for the bubbler in order to check the gas phase concentration upstream the water bottle.,10
64,"Gas phase concentrations were calculated from the measured absorption difference between 451 and 470 nm using Δ (451, 470 nm) = 6.2 × 10 cm.",5
65,This was done alternating with the bypass of the bubbler shut and open.,10
66,The concentration downstream the bubbler (bypass shut) was less than 1% of the concentration upstream (bypass open) indicating that almost all 2-oxopropanal is taken up in the bubbler.,5
67,The amount of 2-oxopropanal taken up after 180 s of bubbling through the water bottle was calculated to be 4.26 × 10 mol.,5
68,"Knowing the volume of the water in the bottle from weighing, a liquid phase concentration of 4.7 × 10 mol l resulted.",5
69,The water bottle and the 2-oxopropanal saturator were weighed before and after the measurement.,10
70,The mass balance was closed within the error limits.,8
71,The spectrum of the resulting solution matches the drop's spectrum very well (see Fig. 3).,8
72,The wavelength dependent absorption coefficient is shown in Fig. 2.,8
73,One band at 284 nm shows a maximum absorption coefficient of  = 16.0 mol l cm.,5
74,No previous measurements of this spectrum are reported in literature.,1
75,"The gas phase concentrations were determined spectroscopically to be (0.67–11.1) × 10 molecules cm of acetone, (0.81–3.8) × 10 molecules cm of 2-butanone, (0.49–2.49) × 10 molecules cm of 2,3-butanedione and (0.60–2.14) × 10 molecules cm of 2-oxopropanal, respectively.",5
76,"For this (280 nm) = 5.05 × 10 cm molecule,(280 nm) = 5.74 × 10 cm molecule,(280 nm) = 4.71 × 10 cm molecule, and (430 nm) = 1.04 × 10 cm molecule, were used.",1
77,"The primary result of each measurement is the absorbance (λ) = () with : liquid phase concentration, : optical path length in the drop, : absorption coefficient.",3
78,"() is the decadic logarithm of the quotient of the intensities of the light at wavelength  entering and leaving the drop, respectively.",1
79,"As shown in a previous publication, the measured uptake coefficient  in the single drop experiment is related to  by: where  is the gas phase concentration of the trace gas species.",6
80,The factor  is unity for all substances in this study;  is an abbreviation used in the following.,6
81,"Because of the limited solubility and diffusivity in the liquid phase, evaporation back to the gas phase will occur as the species taken up is accumulating in the liquid.",1
82,"In the resistance model, this is accounted for by the time dependence of the right hand term in eqn. (1) which increases with increasing exposure time .",6
83,Merging eqns. (1) and (2) and subsequent integration gives the time dependence of the concentration in the liquid: with and,6
84,A fit of the experimental data to eqn. (3) with  and  as parameters gives values for 0.5l and the uptake coefficient  for  = 0 which equals .,6
85,The latter includes only the mass accommodation coefficient  and the effect of the gas phase diffusion.,6
86,A previously developed computer model was employed in order to correct for this effect and obtain values for .,3
87,"Shortly, the model solves the diffusion equation in the gas phase numerically for the period of time the gas phase takes to pass the drop .",3
88,Details are given elsewhere.,1
89,The result of the model calculation is the dependence of the observed  on the mass accommodation coefficient .,0
90,The plots for the four species investigated in this study are shown in Fig. 4.,0
91,The gas phase diffusion coefficients  were calculated from the binary diffusion coefficients  and  according to:,6
92,Experimental data for the binary diffusion coefficients of the species being the subject of this study are not available.,1
93,They were calculated using the method of Fuller,3
94,"However, a change of 10% in  would only cause a change in the calculated  of less than 5% even for the highest -values observed in this study.",3
95,Two limiting cases are visible in Fig. 4.,8
96,"For very low -values, the uptake is only limited by  itself resulting in  = .",5
97,"On the other hand, for very high values of , the gas phase diffusion limits the rate of uptake and  is independent of .",5
98,Note that the four curves shown in Fig. 4 are nearly identical showing almost no visible difference.,8
99,"The time course of the liquid phase concentration of acetone which is shown in Fig. 5 is calculated from the observed differences of the absorptions at 265 and 320 nm, respectively.",3
100,The difference of the absorptions was applied in order to correct for base line shifts.,3
101,The measurements were done at four different gas phase concentrations of acetone.,3
102,Between 9 and 14 individual experiments were used for averaging.,3
103,The qualitative behavior was the same for the different gas phase concentrations and Fig. 6 shows the calculated  according to eqn. (2) for all four of them.,5
104,"As expected, no dependence of the uptake coefficient on the gas phase concentration can be seen.",4
105,The only difference is the decreasing signal to noise ratio with increasing concentration.,8
106,All curves shown in Fig. 6 show a maximum after about 4 s.,8
107,This behavior was already found in a previous study and is attributed to the establishment of a steady state mixing of the drop which is driven by the gas phase flowing around.,1
108,The initial region is excluded in the following fitting procedure because the actual features of the uptake process are only visible after steady state mixing has been reached.,3
109,The maximum value of the uptake coefficient that was observed was 1.8 × 10.,8
110,An assumption made in the resistance model described by eqn. (1) is that the liquid phase is infinitely deep.,6
111,This results in an infinite capacity of the liquid for uptake of the trace species.,6
112,"This, however, can never be the case in a real experiment.",6
113,"Therefore, this model can only fit experimental data for conditions far away from saturation.",6
114,The calculated saturation concentration for a gas phase acetone concentration of 1.11 × 10 molecules cm is about 0.17 mol l using  = 40 mol l atm.,5
115,Only data below a threshold of 40% of this value were used for fitting the measured uptake coefficient to eqn. (3).,3
116,The parameters of the best fit shown in Fig. 5 are  = 3.0 × 10 and  = 4.0 × 10 s.,8
117,"As expected, the fit line shows strong deviations from the experimental data for longer times.",5
118,The uptake process becomes slower than predicted as the drop's capacity for the solute gradually saturates.,5
119,"But, nevertheless, the initial behavior of the concentration is represented very well.",5
120,"After correction for the effect of gas phase diffusion (see Fig. 4),  = (5.4) × 10 is obtained estimating an overall error for  of 30%.",5
121,This is in excellent agreement with the data of Duan . and the estimation method of Ervens,1
122,0.5l = (1.5 ± 0.5) × 10 mol N s is obtained from  eqn. (5).,5
123,"Assuming  = (1 ± 0.2) × 10 m s and an overall error for  of 30%,  is estimated to be in the range 29–71 mol l atm which is in agreement with the measurements.",5
124,The differences between the absorptions at 267 and 320 nm give the time dependent concentration of 2-butanone in the drop.,3
125,"As shown in Fig. 7, the uptake of 2-butanone is quite similar to that of acetone.",8
126,"Between 12 and 14 experiments were averaged for gas phase concentrations of 0.81, 2.44, 3.12 and 3.75 in units of 10 molecules cm of 2-butanone.",3
127,"The maximum value of the time dependent uptake coefficient calculated according to eqn. (2) was 1.5 × 10, independent of the gas phase concentration.",5
128,"Using  = 27 mol l atm, the saturation liquid phase concentration for  = 3.8 × 10 molecules cm is about 4.0 × 10 mol l.",5
129,"Using a 40% of this value threshold, the same fitting procedure was employed as for acetone.",3
130,The parameters for the fit shown in Fig. 7 are  = 1.6 × 10 and  = 4.9 × 10 s with an estimated overall error of 30%.,5
131,= (2.1) × 10 is obtained after correction for the effect of the gas phase diffusion using Fig. 4 which equals the estimation according to Ervens,5
132,0.5l = (1.1 ± 0.3) × 10 mol N s can be extracted from  eqn. (5).,5
133,"With  = (1 ± 0.2) × 10 m s,  is estimated to be between 23 and 50 mol l atm which is in agreement with the measurements.",5
134,"Using the differences of the absorptions at 284 and 334 nm the time dependent concentration in the drop, see Fig. 8, was calculated.",3
135,"The measured time dependent uptake coefficient  is shown in Fig. 9 for the different gas phase concentrations of 2,3-butanedione that were used.",8
136,The mean of at least 12 individual measurements for each gas phase concentration was taken for calculation according to eqn. (2).,3
137,For times larger than 7 s there is no significant difference between the four graphs.,8
138,The variations before this time are attributed to the onset of the mixing of the drop.,4
139,The highest uptake coefficient that was observed is around 8 × 10 neglecting the first 7 s.,5
140,Fig. 8 shows that the saturation of the drop after 100 s is very small unlike the acetone and 2-butanone experiments.,8
141,This is at least partially due to the much larger Henry's law coefficient.,4
142,"Using  = 105 mol l atm, all experimental data are within 30% of the saturation concentration which is around 0.1 mol l for  = 2.49 × 10 molecules cm.",5
143,"Consequently, all data were used for fitting to eqn. (3) except the first 5 s.",3
144,The best fit shown in Fig. 8 as a solid line is obtained using  = 1.0 × 10 and  = 1.9 × 10 s.,8
145,"Employing the computer model for correcting for the gas phase diffusion effect,  = (1.0 ± 0.3) × 10 and 0.5l = (2.6 ± 0.8) × 10 mol N s are obtained.",8
146,The correction is smaller than 5% in this case indicating that the uptake is hardly limited by gas phase diffusion.,5
147,This value for the mass accommodation coefficient is more than one order of magnitude lower than the estimation according to Ervens,4
148,The estimation for  assuming  = (1 ± 0.2) × 10 m s is 53 < /mol l atm < 122 covering literature data.,5
149,"The time dependent concentration of 2-oxopropanal in the drop is calculated from the difference of the absorptions at 284 nm and 334 nm, respectively.",3
150,"The picture shown in Fig. 10 is quite similar to the one for 2,3-butanedione because  is high for this species, too.",8
151,A saturation concentration of  = 4.6 mol l is calculated for  = 2.14 × 10 molecules cm with  = 5.4 × 10 mol l atm.,5
152,All experimental data are well below 2% of this.,8
153,Therefore virtually no effect of saturation is expected.,7
154,This is verified by the plot which nearly is a straight line with constant slope.,5
155,"Measurements were done for gas phase concentrations of 0.6, 0.88, 1.35 and 2.14 × 10 molecules cm of 2-oxopropanal.",3
156,"14 Individual experimental runs were averaged, respectively.",3
157,"For all four concentrations the calculated uptake coefficients  showed the same time course similar to that of 2,3-butanedione with a maximum of about 1.2 × 10.",5
158,The fit to eqn. (3) was performed using all data except the first 5 s yielding  = 1.5 × 10 and  = 7.5 × 10 s with estimated overall errors of 30%.,5
159,The correction for the gas phase was less than 5% leading to  = (1.5 ± 0.5) × 10.,5
160,This value is failed by about a factor of 20 by the estimation method of Ervens .0.5l = (7.2 ± 2.2) × 10 was calculated  eqn. (5).,5
161,"From this,  is estimated to be in the range (1.4–3.4) × 10 mol l atm.",5
162,This is more than one order of magnitude lower than the value given by Betterton and Hoffmann.,4
163,This discrepancy might be due to different influences of the oligomerisation of the carbonyl in both experiments.,4
164,"However, the estimate is still much higher than the values for the other species.",4
165,The resistance model shows strong deviations from the experimental data for larger times as can be seen in Figs. 5 and 7.,8
166,This is due to the assumptions made for deriving eqn. (1) which are not fully met by the present experiment.,2
167,"In order to check which are the effects of these assumptions, the uptake process is treated numerically in an explicit form.",9
168,The liquid was treated as a sphere with concentrical layers of thickness Δ.,6
169,The fluxes of the trace species in and out each sphere where calculated for discrete time steps according to the diffusion equation in spherical coordinates: The flux into the outermost layer which results from the uptake of the trace species from the gas phase is: Here  is the partial pressure of the trace species in the gas phase.,6
170,"For a test of the explicit model, the radius of the drop was set to infinity.",3
171,This situation is comparable to the resistance model where an infinitely deep liquid with a plane surface is assumed for the derivation of the resistance of the bulk liquid (right hand term in eqn. (1)). and  were taken from the best fit in Fig. 5.,1
172,Both models are compared for the uptake of acetone in Fig. 11.,3
173,The principal behavior of the explicit model (dashed line) is the same as that of the resistance model (straight line).,8
174,There is only a little shift which seems to be built up at early times.,8
175,"The shift might be due to another assumption implied in the resistance model,  the decoupling of the individual processes convoluted in the phase transfer.",7
176,This is expressed by an instantaneous saturation of the liquid layer adjacent to the surface.,7
177,The outermost layer becomes only saturated step by step in the explicit model which results in a steeper concentration gradient.,4
178,"Therefore, the flux is larger in the first phase of the uptake process.",4
179,Setting  to the experimental value of 1.1 × 10 m and keeping all other parameters constant gives the dash-dot plot in Fig. 11.,3
180,"While the initial behavior remains unchanged, the modeled concentrations for larger times become smaller than in the resistance model.",8
181,This slower increase is in good agreement with the experiment.,4
182,"Therefore, the deviation of the resistance model from the experiment seems to be mainly resulting in the radial symmetry of the system.",4
183,Another effect that is not included in the resistance model is possible turbulent mixing of the bulk liquid.,1
184,Danckwerts who derived the resistance term for liquid phase saturation in eqn. (1) assumed a ‘quiescent liquid’ in which mass transport is only performed by diffusion.,1
185,"On the other hand, the presence of a mixing motion was observed in the single drop experiment.",1
186,This is supposed to be driven by the gas phase flowing around the drop.,1
187,It takes along the surface layer of the liquid by means of friction from the most up stream area of the drop to the most downstream one.,1
188,"In these regions the liquid is supposed to come from and to go into bulk liquid, respectively.",1
189,"This, in turn, might induce turbulent mixing in the core of the drop.",1
190,"In order to approach this situation in the explicit model, the liquid sphere was divided into two parts, (i) the inner core of radius  which is totally mixed resulting in a uniform concentration profile and (ii) the outer shell which follows the gas phase laminarly and where radial transport is performed by diffusion only.",3
191,This is called the ‘Film model’ in the treatment of Danckwerts.,1
192,The results for different radiuses of the core are compared with the experimental data for acetone in Fig. 12.,3
193,"It can be seen that, although the initial behavior is unaffected, the deviation from the experiment gets larger with increasing core radius.",8
194,It is concluded that in a drop under the present experimental conditions the effect of turbulent mixing on radial transport is negligible.,4
195,"It can be proposed that the observed mixing process proceeds as follows, see Fig. 13 for illustration.",1
196,The surface liquid is flushed to the downstream part of the drop laminarly.,4
197,Subsequently it is passing the drop in a narrow tube around its symmetry axis that is parallel to the gas flow in the converse direction.,4
198,At the end of this tube the liquid is again flushed onto the surface and dragged along by the gas phase again.,4
199,All other parts of the drop follow this circulation laminarly with tracks of a similar shape but smaller size.,4
200,This flow pattern was also the result of study by Chen who solved the governing differential equations for the diffusion simultaneously with those for convective transport.,3
201,The application of the resistance model is verified only for conditions far away from liquid phase saturation as it was done in this study.,4
202,The uptake of four ketones was investigated using a single drop experiment that allows  analysis of the liquid phase by absorption spectroscopy.,9
203,After fitting to a model values for the mass accommodation coefficients  are obtained.,3
204,For acetone and 2-butanone similar values of some 10 are obtained.,8
205,For mass accommodation coefficients of this order of magnitude the rate of gas uptake under tropospheric conditions is affected by both  and,5
206,"However, under the experimental conditions of this study,  large drops with  ≈ 10 m, saturation is reached after roughly 10 s.",8
207,The capacity of tropospheric cloud droplets with  ≈ 10 m is about six orders of magnitude lower.,1
208,"Therefore, saturation is expected to occur on a very short time scale if no reactive sink in the liquid phase would be present.",4
209,"For 2,3-butanedione and 2-oxopropanal mass accommodation coefficients somewhat larger than 10 are obtained.",5
210,The uptake rate under tropospheric conditions is therefore predominantly limited by .,4
211,The Henry's law coefficients for these bicarbonyls are much larger than for the monocarbonyls.,8
212,"Therefore, Henry's law saturation is not reached on the timescale of the present experiment.",4
213,"However, regarding atmospheric aerosol particles having a much lower volumes, it is expected to be reached on a still very short timescale even if the very high  for 2-oxopropanal determined by Betterton and Hoffmann is considered which is about two orders of magnitude larger than that for acetone.",4
214,"According to the present knowledge, tropospheric aqueous phase radical chemistry could establish a sink driven by OH during the day and NO during night-time.",1
215,"If Henry's law equilibrium is established for the trace species, the relative importance of the reactions in the gas and aqueous phase, respectively, can be estimated.",3
216,In Table 1 this is done considering only the reactions with OH in either phase of a continental cloud at 25 °C.,8
217,The partitioning of the trace species between the two phases / is calculated as the product of  and the liquid water content (LWC).,3
218,"In terms of molecule number fractions, less than one per thousand molecules of acetone, 2-butanone and 2-3-butanedione are in the aqueous phase.",5
219,"For 2-oxopropanal having a much higher Henry's law coefficient, only a few percent of the molecules are dissolved.",5
220,"Nevertheless, the picture changes if the ratio of the rates of the reactions between the ketones and OH in either phase are regarded.",8
221,The rate of the aqueous phase reaction is at least four orders of magnitude larger than that for the gas phase reaction for all substances being subject to this study.,5
222,This is due to the higher concentrations of the reactants in the aqueous phase.,4
223,"Multiplying the partitioning / with the ratio of the rates / gives the ratio of the conversions due to the reaction with OH in the aqueous and gas phase, respectively.",3
224,This value is given in the last column of Table 1.,8
225,"Obviously, the conversion by the aqueous phase reaction is much higher for all substances.",8
226,"The uptake parameters obtained in this study will be used for the extension of atmospheric multiphase chemistry models such as CAPRAM in its different versions, see ref.  and references therein.",4
0,Sequential DNA hybridisation assays by fast micromixing,3
1,The prospects of performing DNA hybridisation assays in a novel sequential scheme are explored in this article.,9
2,It is based on recording the kinetics of hybridisation on a microfluidic device measuring only 10 by 5 mm.,9
3,It contains a split channel system for fast mixing and a subsequent meandering channel to observe the evolution of the mixture by optical means.,9
4,The problems of diffusion limitations in the laminar flow regime are overcome by reducing the average diffusion distance to a few micrometers only.,9
5,DNA oligomers (20-mers) of different sequences were injected on the chip for mixing.,10
6,The detection of hybridisation was based on the fluorescence of DNA-intercalating dyes.,10
7,Two modes of operation were investigated.,10
8,"First, the samples were injected into the micromixing device at a high flow rate of 40 µl min.",10
9,"When the sample passed through the actual micromixing unit, the flow rate was reduced to allow for measurement of fluorescence levels at various steady-state reaction times in the range of 2–15 s, as defined by the channel geometry.",10
10,"Using this continuous flow approach, photobleaching of fluorophores could be avoided.",8
11,"In a buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl, 2 base-pair mismatches could routinely be detected within 5–20 s.",5
12,Single base-pair mismatches were successfully identified under low salt conditions.,5
13,"In the second mode, the flow was completely stopped and the evolution of the total fluorescence signal influenced by the hybridisation of oligomers and photobleaching was observed.",10
14,"Whereas the sequence-dependent effects remained unchanged, the assay times between the mixing of two oligomers and clear identification of their hybridisation properties could be reduced down to a maximum of 5–7 s, in some cases even below 1 s.",5
15,DNA hybridisation reactions are at the core of biological and medical analysis.,1
16,"Performed in vast numbers, one of the most valuable platforms are DNA microarrays where probe oligomer sequences representing genes of interest are immobilised and incubated with a mixture of unknown target DNA.",1
17,Fluorescent labelling techniques are predominantly used to identify the sites where probe and target sequences match.,3
18,The performance of DNA microarrays is impressive as integration with microsystem technology progresses to increase the number of probe oligomer per unit area.,3
19,"Thereby, the information density is increased considerably and enables large-scale genomic analysis such as gene expression profiling of whole organisms.",3
20,"Although it seems that many application needs in industrial research and high-throughput screening can be satisfied with microarrays, there is an on-going interest in alternative DNA hybridisation technology,  hybridisation-based sensors that depend on other sensing devices like fiber optics, surface plasmon resonance sensors or acoustic wave sensors.",3
21,Especially attractive solutions were presented particle-based probe oligomer immobilisation schemes.,3
22,"Yamashita . proposed a microfluidic system based totally on laminar flow, where the DNA hybridisation occurs at the interface between the streams.",3
23,"By tailoring the geometry of channel bends on their chip, only the newly formed and fluorescence-labelled DNA duplexes migrate into the bulk region of the second laminar stream for detection.",3
24,Another interesting contribution from Tamiya's group suggested the use of silicon micromachining to create platelet-like particles for immobilisation whose shape characteristics alone could code for different functionalisation and still be easily identifiable in mixtures.,3
25,"However, there is a distinct lack of scale-up potential towards high-throughput applications in most of these approaches.",3
26,"In some cases, the beads coated with probes could be sorted into a silicon frame and became individually addressable.",3
27,We wish to present a different approach with potential for high-throughput application by combining purely solution-based DNA hybridisation reactions with the use of a microfluidic system.,3
28,This device overcomes the mixing problem that is inherent to most microfluidic systems which work in the laminar flow regime and is based on the fine distribution of two laminar inlet flows (Fig. 1).,3
29,DNA hybridisation assays are performed in series by injecting the sample solutions one after the other and mix them rapidly on the chip.,10
30,Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are detectable.,8
31,"If such a scheme is to be used for a large number of analyses in sequence, the single assay has to be performed within a short time to become comparable to the enormous multiplexing performance of microarray technology.",1
32,The prospect of decreasing the time of one assay to the order of 1 s is presented.,8
33,"Potentially, this technology could allow for many thousand assays within just a few hours.",3
34,"By using solution-based DNA chemistry, the need for immobilisation schemes is eliminated.",3
35,"Due to restrictions of molecular diffusion near surfaces, the kinetics of heterogeneous hybridisation assays are slower, as characterised in literature.",2
36,The detection of DNA hybridisation is based on the fluorescent dye PicoGreen that selectively enhances its fluorescence upon binding to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).,1
37,"Typically, such intercalating reagents are used for DNA quantification.",1
38,The setup consisted of a Leica DM IL inverted microscope with fluorescence detection equipment as depicted in Fig. 1c.,3
39,"The glass-silicon-glass sandwiched micromixing device was secured in a custom-made aluminium holder by pressing PEEK capillaries and silicone ferrules (Upchurch Scientific, Eugene, Oregon, USA) into the access holes of the microchip.",10
40,"There were two light sources installed, one a halogen lamp for bright-field imaging, the other lamp a high-performance Hg-lamp (50 W) for fluorescence excitation.",10
41,Various neutral density filters could be inserted before the fluorescence filter set in order to attenuate the excitation light.,10
42,"Connected to the microscope was a photomultiplier tube (PMT) Cairn Integra (Cairn Research Ltd., Faversham, UK).",3
43,Its preamplifier analog voltage output was connected to a National Instruments PCI DAQ card for direct digitalization of the PMT data.,3
44,Liquid pumping was done using a Harvard PhD 2000 syringe pump equipped to hold up to two Hamilton syringes.,3
45,"One input line was connected to a Rheodyne EV750-100 6-port injection valve (Rheodyne LLC, Rohnert Park, California, USA) which was equipped with a 20 µl sample loop.",10
46,A video camera for capturing live and still images was installed on the top port of the PMT mirror assembly.,10
47,"By the use of dichroic mirrors which split the light at 600 nm, the camera remained connected in parallel to the PMT so that detection window and positions could be checked shortly before and during measurement.",10
48,The detection window was defined by an adjustable rectangular aperture of 160 by 200 µm.,10
49,The fluorescence light was collected at highest magnification through a 32× objective (NA = 0.4).,10
50,The whole setup was computer-controlled using LabView and was placed in a cloth-clad cubicle in order to avoid stray light.,10
51,A solution of 0.385 mM fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dissolved in MeOH was used in a mixing experiment with water.,10
52,The components were mixed at a total flow rate of 120 µl min.,10
53,"Gel-filtered DNA oligomers were synthesized by Eurogentech, Romsey, UK and used as received.",10
54,The lyophilised DNA oligomers were reconstituted using sterile and RNAse free water.,10
55,"The following sequences were used for the present work, a base sequence A: 5′-GTTTATTAATGCGGCCCGCG-3′, its perfect match A′: 5′-CGCGGGCCGCATTAATAAAC-3′, as well as sequences containing increasing numbers of base pair mismatches, A-1: 5′-CGCGGGCGCATTAATAAAC-3′, A-2: 5′-CGCGGCCGCATTATAAAC-3′ and A-5: 5′-CGGAGCGCATATAAC-3′.",10
56,Location of mismatches are indicated in bold-oblique letters.,10
57,The hybridisation properties of various oligomer mixtures were also confirmed by DNA sizing on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyser.,10
58,"To ensure temperature stability and constant lighting conditions ., each experiment consisted of different injections done in the same run within a few hours.",10
59,"PicoGreen was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc., Leiden, Netherlands.",10
60,"For a typical experiment, 3 ml of buffer solution containing 34.5 mg NaCl (0.2 M) and 8.9 mM tris-borate/0.2 mM EDTA at pH 8.3 were prepared and put under vacuum for degassing.",10
61,"To this buffer, the appropriate amount of oligomer and PicoGreen dye (typically 5 µl of PicoGreen diluted in water 1:10) was added shortly before the experiment.",10
62,"The first syringe connected directly to one inlet usually contained 450 µl of a 0.8–8 µM (5–50 µg ml) target oligomer solution, the syringe supplying the other inlet contained 450 µl pure buffer and was used as carrier stream through the Rheodyne injection valve.",10
63,Probe oligomer solutions for injection were at the same concentration unless indicated otherwise.,10
64,"Between experiments, the chip was filled with liquid in order to avoid air bubbles forming and occasionally flushed with buffer and EtOH/MeOH or 2-propanol to keep the microchannels clean.",10
65,Calibration experiments to assess the detection limit of dsDNA within a large background of ssDNA were performed.,10
66,All solutions were prepared with excess oligomer to mimic the initial stages of hybridisation with the corresponding amount of unreacted oligomer.,10
67,"A 5 µM stock solution of dsDNA (A:A′) was diluted to 1, 2, 20, 40, 80, 160 × 10 M concentrations to which another equivalent of A was added to bring the total oligomer concentration in the system to a total of 8 µM (comprising dsDNA and ssDNA).",10
68,"This time, the solutions were injected on the microchannels through the outlet since the micromixing function was not necessary.",10
69,Fluorescence levels were recorded for both stopped flow and continuous 40 µl min.,10
70,"As the results of the calibration run indicate, dsDNA concentrations of 200–400 nM could readily be detected (not shown).",8
71,"Where applicable in terms of comparable experimental conditions, a linear fit to this calibration was used to convert the PMT voltage scale to concentration units.",3
72,The PMT data was first normalised to the measured basic fluorescence level of one oligomer/PicoGreen solution mixed 1 : 1 with buffer.,3
73,The high efficiency of mixing in the laminar flow regime is brought about by splitting each of the two inlet streams into 16 smaller substreams which then are joined and recombined (Fig. 1a).,10
74,Details concerning the design and microfabrication procedures of the device are given elsewhere.,1
75,"Briefly, channels and through-holes were micromachined into a silicon wafer from both sides by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) using three photolithography masks.",10
76,The silicon wafer then was sandwiched by anodic bonding of a plain glass wafer at the bottom and a glass wafer featuring sand-blasted access holes on top and finally diced to yield single chips.,10
77,The channel surfaces had not been functionalised in any way.,10
78,"Hence, a layer of adsorbed oligomers on the open SiO surfaces had to be expected.",7
79,"Due to the excitation light source containing significant intensity in the UV range, an irreversibly bound monomolecular layer is likely to have formed.",7
80,"However, due to the dynamic operation mode featuring only short interruptions of a continuous flow, the immensely larger detection volume, the DNA concentrations used and frequent flushings, no evidence of adverse effects on the fluorescence signals was found.",8
81,"In addition, the intense excitation light source was constantly illuminating the channel system (see positioning of aperture in Fig. 1c), thus quenching any remaining fluorescence from possible adsorbates by photobleaching.",3
82,"With the present system geometry, Reynold numbers of  = 1.6 to 4.8 have been calculated for the flow rates of 40 to 120 µl min of aqueous oligomer solutions used within this project.",5
83,"In the absence of turbulence at  < 2,000, the only transport mechanism for mixing is diffusion.",4
84,The splitting of flows therefore reduces the average diffusion distance to approx.,4
85,"10 µm, see also Fig. 1b where micrographs of the stratified laminar flow pattern after mixing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) with water are shown.",4
86,"A meandering channel allows for downstream observation of the flow, . after 30 ms the laminar pattern has been washed out by diffusion.",8
87,"The splitting of flows leads to a significant decrease in mixing times down to the order of ms, since the diffusion distance  follows a root law as function of diffusion coefficient  and time",5
88,A literature overview of some diffusion properties in water for various molecules of interest are summarised in Table 1.,1
89,"Smaller molecules like FITC easily cover 7–8 µm within 100 ms, whereas DNA oligomers and double-stranded pieces of 20 bp length take up to approximately 1 s for the same distance.",2
90,This is due to their diffusion coefficient being approx.,2
91,10× smaller.,2
92,"It is important to note that these values may vary depending on the actual experimental conditions like buffers, pH, temperature, DNA sequence and functionalisation .",2
93,"Therefore, these literature values were used as a guideline only.",1
94,All the characteristics addressed above led to the decision to vary the flow rate in the present work by mixing probe and target oligomer quickly using a high flow rate and subsequently slowing down or stopping the flow to allow for enough time to observe the evolution of the DNA hybridisation reaction.,0
95,The downstream channel volume of 480 nl would only allow for a time window of 600 ms at typical flow rate of 40 µl min.,3
96,"Therefore, these reductions of the flow-rate or stop-flow schemes were required.",3
97,"Since the detection of hybridisation is based on intercalating dyes which increase the quantum yield of fluorescence upon interacting with dsDNA, the following contributions to the overall fluorescence level can be expected: (i) the fluorescence of the intercalating dye in solution without DNA interaction, (ii) interaction of the dye with ssDNA, (iii) intercalation into oligomer-dimers, (iv) intercalation into dsDNA.",7
98,"Of these contributions, (i) should be negligible (ii) is expected to remain constant throughout the experiments, or, in the case of matching oligomers, is expected to become negligible as ssDNA is consumed by hydridisation, (iv) desirably the strongest and (iii) will have to be controlled carefully, since it may vary depending on the probe sequences of the oligomers in use.",7
99,"Newer intercalating dyes like PicoGreen seem to fulfil these requirements, especially since the brightness increase upon binding to dsDNA is reported to be 2 orders of magnitude.",1
100,A typical experiment mixing oligomer A with A′ is depicted in Fig. 2a.,8
101,"At 40 µl min the injection valve is switched to its inject position for 10 s, injecting approximately 3.3 µl of probe oligomer solution.",10
102,"Concurrently with switching the valve back to the load state, the flow is abruptly reduced to a flow rate of 2 µl min.",10
103,After 10–20 s another steady state of the fluorescence signal is reached.,8
104,"For demonstration of the repeatability of this flow rate change, the flow rate is temporarily brought back to 40 µl min for just a short moment (at 45 s).",10
105,The signal recovers to the same steady-state level after that.,8
106,The experiment is ended at 80 s by flushing the system at 40 µl min.,10
107,Both oligomer concentrations were 2.4 µM.,10
108,"The observed difference in fluorescence intensity before and after the flow rate reduction step, ΔPMT, was evaluated to detect oligomers that match or, respectively, mismatch in varying degrees.",3
109,The ΔPMT values of sequence-dependent experiments are shown in Fig. 2b.,8
110,The same experiment as described above was performed with various mismatch combinations.,3
111,Matching oligomers A/A′ and 1-mismatch A/A-1 could not be distinctly resolved.,8
112,This is attributed to the high NaCl concentration of 0.2 M which was initially chosen to maximise the reaction rate at fixed oligomer concentrations.,4
113,The error of multiple injections was dominated by the fluctuations of the mercury-arc lamp that was used.,3
114,"However, if the NaCl content is reduced to 40 mM, the stringency of hybridisation is increased.",5
115,"Using these conditions, single base-pair mismatches A/A-1 were successfully distinguished from A/A′ at 4.8 µM oligomer concentrations (Fig. 2c).",8
116,"As both syringes were driven by the same pump, the mixing ratio was fixed to 1:1.",3
117,"However, due to individual pressure variations upon flow rate change, deviations from this 1:1 ratio had to be taken into account.",3
118,"Therefore, the initial response always carries some unwanted spike which was characterised by observing the effect of flow-rate change without injecting a sample.",8
119,"In those cases, the corresponding fluorescence response of only the change in flow rate without sample injection is also displayed.",8
120,The difference between the two steady-state levels is indicative of the hybridisation reaction rate.,4
121,"As Fig. 2c also shows, the higher concentrations used in the single base-pair mismatch experiments yields a much shorter settling time of only 5 s to reach flow equilibrium.",8
122,A sharp increase in fluorescence brightness was obtained when injecting the complementary 20-mer A′ to the basic sequence A and stopping the flow.,8
123,The injection time of 10 s was again chosen in order to fill the channel downstream of the mixing unit long enough to perform several stop-flow measurements.,10
124,"A series of three injections is shown in Fig. 3a for [A] = constant = 8 × 10 M and [A′] = 8 × 10 M, resp.",8
125,4 × 10 M and 1.6 × 10 M. The curves each show the behaviour after stopping the flow 3 times and give an impression of the reproducibility.,8
126,"From top to bottom, the dilution of [A′] is shown.",8
127,"Clearly, the steady-state fluorescence level follows the dilution series quantitatively.",8
128,The hybridisation kinetics of DNA oligomers can be described as a reaction following second order kinetics with a rate constant  of approximately 5.7 × 10 Ms.,1
129,The time-law of dsDNA formation for equal oligomer concentrations is given by where  is the initial concentration of both oligomers and  the rate constant.,6
130,Calculation of the 90% conversion value yields a value of  = 1.98 s.,5
131,"Therefore, considering the specific conditions used in the experiments, the hybridisation should be faster than the mixing process by diffusion.",7
132,One expects to measure the response of the mixing system rather than the hybridisation kinetics themselves.,7
133,"As Fig. 3a confirms, the times after the stopping of flow required to reach a steady fluorescence level do not change by diluting the concentration of one oligomer.",8
134,Linearisation to the root law of diffusion (1) of the time-dependent response shows that the hybridisation is indeed in the diffusion-limited regime for 20 s after which the increase in fluorescence deviates from the root law (Fig. 3b).,5
135,Possible explanations for this deviation are the completion of the mixing process or the onset of photobleaching as the intense excitation light is constantly focussed on the same volume element of the liquid after halting the flow.,4
136,The  values scale linearly with concentrations.,8
137,"Hence, it has to be expected that using lower concentrations will eventually lead to a kinetic limitation of the response.",7
138,"If this micromixing/stopped flow scheme is going to be used for genomic analysis, the dependence of the response to variations in sequence will be crucial.",2
139,Examples of sequence series are given in Fig. 4.,8
140,The A sequence was provided to the first inlet and the other oligomers were injected via the Rheodyne valve to the second inlet with injection times of 10 s.,10
141,"A′ and A-1 containing one mismatched base pair coincide, whereas the first differences become evident for the two-mismatch oligomer, A-2.",8
142,"In the case of A-5, the fluorescence increase is distinctly lower reflecting the thermodynamic equilibrium being shifted to the oligomer side.",5
143,True single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) detection could again not be achieved due to the NaCl content (0.2 M).,4
144,"However, the same way as control probe sequences containing an additional mismatch close to the target mismatch are included in microarray applications, such an approach could equally be applied for the proposed micromixing approach.",1
145,Further variations in buffer composition also lead to less ‘mismatch-tolerant’ and more stringent hybridisation conditions.,8
146,"High-throughput application of this scheme demands for a quick succession of assays, . another assay every 1–5 s.",2
147,It is not necessary to wait for the hybridisation to complete for obtaining the information whether two particular probe to target sequences match.,1
148,This will constitute an optimisation problem between fast detection and the resulting sequence-related levels of confidence.,1
149,"Parameters to consider are the diffusion-controlled mixing or the kinetics of hybridisation and the sensitivity of detection, especially the detection of small dsDNA amounts in a large background of oligomers.",2
150,"A true high-speed approach is shown in Fig. 5, where multiple stops on A mixed with A′, and A mixed with A-5 are depicted.",8
151,Particular to this experiment was the removal of all ND filters to have the highest excitation light intensity that the setup permitted.,3
152,Photobleaching effects now become very significant and the hybridisation/intercalation process produces just enough additional fluorescence to temporarily outweigh the photobleaching.,8
153,"Therefore, the signal obtained only increases in the case of matching oligomer sequences.",8
154,"In the case of mismatching sequences, A-5 to A, only a decay of fluorescence is recorded.",8
155,"First, such a scheme could provide for a signal with less ambiguity than the previous ones shown before by exhibiting a clear increase/decrease of fluorescence brightness.",4
156,"Second, the magnified extracts that show the onset of the signal upon halting the flow are only 1 s, clearly indicating the possibility to discriminate matching/nonmatching situations with a signal change in the range of 10% within the first second of observation.",4
157,We have demonstrated an alternative approach for performing DNA hybridisation assays in sequence.,3
158,The enabling tool is a microsystem of passive mixing channels with subsequent observation channel.,3
159,DNA hybridisation at high concentrations was found to be diffusion-limited.,8
160,Sequence dependent signals down to SNP-level were successfully recorded.,5
161,"A mode of operation suitable for high-throughput applications was found, where the signal shows within 1 s whether two oligomers match.",5
162,"Whereas technological difficulties such as the periphery providing a steady stream of samples still need to be addressed, we believe this method could provide for a very flexible and versatile platform for genomic analysis.",4

0,Photodissociation dynamics of pyrrole: Evidence for mode specific dynamics from conical intersections,9
1,The H and D atom elimination mechanisms in the photodissociation of jet cooled pyrrole and pyrrole- have been studied by photofragment velocity map imaging.,9
2,The molecules were excited to the 1 A (πσ*) state at  = 243 nm and to the 1 B (ππ*) state at  = 217 nm.,10
3,H/D atoms were detected by (2 + 1) resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) at  = 243 nm.,3
4,"The analysis of the images and the resulting translational energy distributions from the 1 A state demonstrates the existence of two decay pathways, fast mode-specific cleavage of the NH bond in the excited state (channel A) and internal conversion (IC) to the electronic ground state (S) followed by unimolecular decomposition of the vibrationally hot S molecules (channel B).",5
5,"The angular distributions of the H/D atoms from the direct dissociation in the excited state are strongly anisotropic, whereas the decay of the S molecules leads to spatially isotropic distributions.",8
6,The results at  = 217 nm indicate that the 1 B state undergoes an ultrafast radiationless transition to 1 A followed by the abovementioned direct mode-specific NH bond fission on the 1 A potential energy surface (channel A′) or conversion to S and subsequent unimolecular decomposition (channel B′).,5
7,The latter pathway may also be initiated by a direct relaxation from 1 B to S.,5
8,The anisotropy parameter of  ≈ –1 for the direct NH bond fission at  = 217 nm is in accordance with the expectations for a perpendicular electronic excitation and a dissociation lifetime that is short compared to the rotational period of the molecules.,8
9,"The fast decay dynamics of both excited electronic states can be rationalized with reference to the theoretically predicted conical intersections between the ππ*, πσ*, and S potential energy surfaces and the antibonding nature of the πσ* potential energy surface with respect to the NH bond [A. L. Sobolewski, W. Domcke, C. Dedonder-Lardeux and C. Jouvet,  2002, , 1093].",4
10,"Recent excited state  calculations for H atom photodetachment processes from NH-containing heteroaromatic compounds, aromatic amines, or phenols have suggested a new paradigm for the photochemical dynamics in these systems.",1
11,"Accordingly, the fate of the photoexcited molecules is controlled by conical intersections between the usually strongly absorbing first excited ππ* state, a neighboring optically dark πσ* state, and the S electronic ground state.",3
12,The key role in the ensuing dynamics is played by the πσ* state which becomes repulsive along the NH or OH stretching coordinates and intersects the S state at long NH/OH bond lengths because the latter does not adiabatically correlate with the respective dissociation products in their electronic ground states.,3
13,Conical intersections between the ππ* and πσ* and the πσ* and S potential energy hypersurfaces thus open efficient pathways for radiationless electronic transitions leading to an ultrafast relaxation of the excited molecules to the electronic ground state and/or to a fast NH/OH bond fission and corresponding dissociation of the molecules.,1
14,"These mode specific channels have been postulated to have great importance for the photochemical properties of the nucleic acid bases and the biologically relevant aromatic amino acids, for intramolecular H atom transfer reactions in excited electronic states (ESIHT), and for photo-induced intermolecular H atom transfer reactions in hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes.",1
15,The pyrrole molecule is an almost ideal model system for which the photochemical dynamics can be studied in detail.,2
16,"In addition, it is a building block of many biologically important compounds which may show related mechanisms.",2
17,"Last but not least, it plays a role in the synthesis of biologically active compounds, pesticides, organic polymers, and organometallic magnets.",2
18,"The UV absorption spectrum of pyrrole shows two strong bands, the first with an intensity maximum near  = 210 nm, the second near 165 nm.",1
19,"In addition, a very weak feature is observed with a maximum around 240 nm.",1
20,The spectrum between 190 and 260 nm is reproduced in Fig. 1.,1
21,"As can be seen, the absorption bands are very broad and unstructured and this has hampered their analysis for a long time.",2
22,"Further work has been performed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, and resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI).",3
23,"In addition, the experimental studies were complemented by theoretical electronic structure investigations.",3
24,The most recent quantum chemical calculations by Roos . showed that the bulk of the intensity of the 210 nm band arises from the intra-valence transition to the 1 B (ππ*) state.,1
25,A small contribution (≈15%) may also come from the neighboring 2 A (ππ*) state.,1
26,The 165 nm band has been attributed to the excitation to the 1 B and 2 B states which belong to the 3p Rydberg series.,1
27,"The analysis of the weak 240 nm band has, however, been controversial.",2
28,The respective transition has traditionally been assigned to the 1 A (3s) Rydberg state.,1
29,The observation of this electronically forbidden band can be explained by a vibronic coupling with the 1 B (ππ*) state induced by out-of-plane vibrations (b symmetry).,1
30,One earlier paper has also assigned the 240 nm band to the excited 2 A valence state.,1
31,"However, Sobolewski and Domcke recently demonstrated that the stretching of the NH bond in the 1 A state leads to a Rydberg-to-valence transformation by which that bond becomes anti-bonding, , the electron configuration becomes πσ*.",1
32,"The Rydberg character remains evident by the diffuseness of the σ* orbital, but the πσ* character was postulated to be responsible for a fast mode-specific N–H bond dissociation and, through a conical intersection with the S state, for an efficient radiationless relaxation of the electronically excited molecules.",1
33,"Moreover, a fast predissociation of the ππ* state by the πσ* state was suggested to explain the apparently extremely short lifetimes of the excited states of pyrrole and the resulting absence of observations of laser induced fluorescence.",1
34,"Direct experimental evidence for these theoretically predicted processes had, however, been missing.",2
35,"In a recent communication, we reported on first results of an investigation of the formation of H atoms from pyrrole and, for comparison, -methylpyrrole in their lowest excited electronic states by photofragment velocity map imaging.",1
36,"Pyrrole was excited to the 1 A (πσ*) state at  = 243 nm, and the nascent H atoms were detected at the same wavelength by 2 + 1 REMPI.",3
37,The observed H atom velocity maps showed the existence of two dissociation channels.,1
38,"The first was found to produce very fast H atoms and appeared to be due to a rapid direct NH bond cleavage in the excited electronic state, as predicted by the theoretical studies.",1
39,"The H atom kinetic energy distribution had a strong, narrow peak at high translational energies.",1
40,"The less important second channel was observed to lead to much slower H atoms with a very broad kinetic energy distribution, consistent with a statistical formation  unimolecular decay reactions in the electronic ground state after internal conversion from the excited state.",1
41,This conclusion was supported by the results for -methylpyrrole which showed only H atoms corresponding to the second channel.,1
42,The experimental results thus corroborated the proposal by Sobolewski and Domcke that the lowest excited electronic state of pyrrole has πσ* character and is anti-bonding with respect to the stretching of the N–H bond.,1
43,"In this discussion paper, we present the results of an extended study of the photochemical dynamics of normal pyrrole (pyrrole-) and selectively deuterated pyrrole (pyrrole-) at two excitation wavelengths,  = 243 nm and  = 217 nm.",9
44,"The reactions studied can be written as CHNH +  → H + CHNandCHND +  → D + CHN → H + CHNDThe two excitation wavelengths (243 and 217 nm) will be indicated below by unprimed and primed labels, where appropriate.",6
45,"In the first set of experiments ( = 243 nm, one colour), we probed the H and D atom photodetachment from both isotopomers  the 1 A (πσ*) state.",10
46,"The obtained new D atom images from pyrrole- (reaction (2d)) were seen to exhibit an efficient ultrafast mode-specific dissociation of the ND bond of the molecules on the πσ* potential energy surface, confirming the corresponding interpretation of our earlier experiments and providing direct evidence for the theoretical predictions of Sobolewski and Domcke.",8
47,"In the second set of experiments, we performed two-colour measurements, in which the molecules were excited to the 1 B (ππ*) state at  = 217 nm and the H atoms were again probed at  = 243 nm.",10
48,The results of these experiments corroborate the postulate that the 1 B (ππ*) state is predissociated by the repulsive πσ* state.,4
49,The photofragment velocity map imaging apparatus built in our laboratory will be described in some detail elsewhere.,1
50,The basic set-up resembles that of Eppink and Parker.,1
51,A gas mixture containing ≈0.1% of pyrrole in He was prepared by bubbling the seed gas through a sample of liquid pyrrole stored in a glass reservoir at –20 °C and 1 bar pressure.,10
52,The gases expanded into a differentially pumped stainless steel vacuum chamber through a solenoid actuated pulsed valve (General Valve #9) operated at 10 Hz repetition rate with ≈350 µs pulse opening times.,10
53,A molecular beam entered the second vacuum stage through a 1 mm diameter electroformed conical skimmer (Beam Dynamics).,10
54,"Based on our experience with other molecules under similar expansion conditions, the rotational temperature of the pyrrole in the molecular beam was estimated to be of the order of  ≈ (20 ± 10) K.",8
55,The photolysis/probe laser beams intersected the molecular beam at right angle halfway between the repeller and extractor plates of the Wiley-McLaren ion imaging electrode assembly.,10
56,A liquid nitrogen cryo-pump surrounding the arrangement minimized the residual hydrocarbon background.,10
57,The laser radiation at  = 243 nm (≈0.05–1.4 mJ) was generated by frequency-doubling the output of a Nd:YAG pumped dye laser (Quanta-Ray GCR-3/Lambda Physik FL-3002) in a BBO I crystal and focused into the molecular beam with an  = 1 m lens.,3
58,Light at  = 217 nm (≈0.1–2.0 mJ) was generated by frequency-doubling the output of a XeCl excimer pumped dye laser (Lambda Physik EMG 201/Lambda Physik FL-3002) in a BBO II crystal.,3
59,"To avoid a photolysis of the pyrrole with the  = 243 nm probe light in the two-colour experiments, the probe power was lowered until the 243 nm one-colour signal in the absence of the 217 nm photolysis beam had virtually disappeared.",10
60,The probe beam was time-delayed by ≈15 ns with respect to the counterpropagating photolysis beam.,10
61,The laser polarizations were oriented with the electric field vectors perpendicular to the plane defined by the molecular beam and the laser beams using Wollaston polarizers and Fresnel double rhombs.,10
62,All imaging measurements were made under velocity mapping conditions.,10
63,The probe laser was periodically scanned by ±6 cm resp. ±4 cm around the line centers of the recoiling H and D atoms to cover their complete Doppler profiles.,10
64,The resulting H/D ions were detected by a microchannel plate (MCP) detector coupled to a phosphorescence screen.,10
65,"The obtained signals were recorded with a CCD camera (640 × 480 pixels, LaVision) and accumulated over up to 200 000 laser shots using single ion counting and centroiding to improve the detection sensitivity and spatial resolution and discriminate against noise.",10
66,Background images were taken under the same experimental conditions with the molecular beam valve closed.,10
67,Mass selectivity was achieved using a fast transistor switch (Behlke) to gate the MCP voltage.,10
68,"Normal pyrrole (Aldrich, 98%) was used after repeated fractionated distillation until the liquid was clear.",10
69,Catalytic reactions in the stainless steel supply pipe were suppressed by maintaining a slow flow of the pyrrole/carrier gas mixture through a 1 mm id teflon tube extending in the supply line from the sample reservoir all the way to the molecular beam nozzle.,10
70,Pyrrole- was prepared from the normal isotopomer by repeated stirring with excess DO.,10
71,The final product was dried over NaCO.,10
72,The deuteration (>97%) was checked by NMR spectroscopy.,3
73,The gas supply lines of the apparatus were thoroughly purged overnight with DO vapour before the measurements with the deuterated sample to prevent isotope exchange with HO at the walls.,10
74,The two-dimensional (2D) velocity mapped H/D images provided by the experiments at  = 243 nm and  = 217 nm were inverse Abel transformed to obtain the respective three-dimensional (3D) velocity distributions using the basis-set expansion method of Dribinski,6
75,"The required calibrations were performed by measuring H/D photofragment images from HBr/DBr and HI/DI, for which the dissociation energies are precisely known (00(HBr) = 30 210 cm, 00(HI) = 24 630 cm).",6
76,The results obtained at the two excitation wavelengths will be considered separately.,1
77,The H atom image from pyrrole- and the D and H atom images from pyrrole- recorded in the one-colour photodissociation experiments at  = 243 nm are displayed in Fig. 2a–c in the upper row.,8
78,The respective 3D velocity distributions are given in the second row.,8
79,"All images show a clearly visible, spatially anisotropic outer ring corresponding to very fast H/D atoms with a sharply peaked speed distribution and a diffuse, spatially isotropic inner region reflecting slower H/D atoms with a broad speed distribution.",8
80,"With the data for the deuterated molecule, these distinctive dissociation channels can be identified with some confidence.",1
81,"Reiterating first the conclusions for the case of pyrrole- (reaction (1), Fig. 2a), the fast H atoms can be attributed to the direct NH dissociation in the πσ* state (referred to in our earlier paper and in the following as channel A) and the slower H atoms may be ascribed to unimolecular decay reactions after internal conversion (IC) to the S state (referred to as channel B).",1
82,"However, the evidence for the assignment of the fast H atoms to the NH group had so far only been circumstantial.",1
83,"The present results provide the missing additional information: In particular, it can be seen from the image for reaction (2d) in Fig. 2b that the sharp ring of fast D atoms from pyrrole-, for which the site of the D atom is unambiguous, is even more striking than that of the H atoms from pyrrole- (Fig. 2a).",5
84,"At the same time, the slow D atom signal from pyrrole- is the by far weakest in the series.",5
85,These results demonstrate clearly that the fast D atoms originate from the N position and not from any of the four C positions of the parent molecule.,4
86,"In contrast, pyrrole- shows the highest intensity of slow H atoms in the series of the three molecules (Fig. 2c, channel B), although there is also a small fraction of fast H atoms from pyrrole-.",5
87,"The latter observation may indicate the existence of a third pathway (referred to in the following as channel C, see discussion).",7
88,The relative yields of D and H from pyrrole- were determined by recording a REMPI spectrum (Fig. 3).,3
89,"From the ratio of the integrated signals, the ND group accounts for ≈(74 ± 5)% of the observed atoms, while the four CH sites account for ≈(26 ± 5)%.",5
90,"On a per bond basis, CH dissociation is therefore really only a minor process.",4
91,"In the following, the attention will be focused mainly on the direct dissociation dynamics  channel A.",1
92,The total center-of-mass (cm) translational energy distributions () of the photofragments which follow by integrating the 3D velocity distributions (Fig. 2) over the angular directions and applying linear momentum conservation for the two fragments are given in Fig. 4a–c.,8
93,The areas under the experimental curves in the three panels were normalized with respect to each other to reflect the respective branching ratios.,6
94,The clearly bimodal distributions nicely confirm the existence of the aforementioned distinctive dissociation channels that were apparent from the images.,5
95,"In order to determine quantitative data for a comparison of the three isotopomers and their dynamics at the two photoexcitation wavelengths, the () profiles were fitted by using a sharply peaked Gaussian to represent the contributions of the fast atoms and a simple polynomial to account for the broad background of slow atoms.",6
96,"As seen, the experimental profiles could be nicely described.",8
97,"Alternatively, the fast atoms were also modeled using a three-parameter trial function of the form() = [T(1 – )],where  is the fraction of the available excess energy () channeled into fragment translation.",6
98,"This flexible fitting function has the advantage that , which is given by the photon energy minus the dissociation energy of the molecules, can be determined by the fitting.",1
99,"Apart from this point, however, the differences between using this expression or the Gaussian were negligible.",5
100,The parameters from the fits are compiled in Table 1.,8
101,"In addition, the table lists the relative yields (branching ratios)  of the different dissociation channels given by the areas under the respective curves.",8
102,"For reaction (2), the  values account for the branching ratio between (2d) and (2h) from Fig. 3 so that the total yield is ∑  = 1.",5
103,"The energy balance for the dissociation according to channel A is given by  = 00 +  + PyVR – PVR. is the photon energy, 00 the NH/ND bond dissociation energy,  the total translational energy of the two fragments, PyVR the vibration–rotation energy of the pyrrolyl co-product, and PVR the internal energy of the parent molecules.",6
104,"Considering the efficient cooling of the molecules in the molecular beam expansion, the latter term is small and may be neglected.",6
105,"Thus, the available energy partitioned among the translational and internal (vibration–rotation) degrees of freedom of the fragments is  =  – 00 =  + PyVR.Since the fastest H/D atoms may be assumed to correspond to internally cold pyrrolyl radicals (PyVR ≈ 0),  can be determined from the sharp cut-off of the () distribution at the allowed maximal value (maxT) of  , eqn. (I).",6
106,The data are given in Table 1.,8
107,The corresponding values for the bond dissociation energy according to eqn. (III) are,5
108,"Furthermore, it can be seen from Table 1 that  about 67% of the available energy is channeled into relative fragment translation, 33% is deposited as internal energy in the pyrrolyl radical.",5
109,The photofragment angular distributions () are obtained in principle by integrating the 3D velocity maps in Fig. 2 over the radii.,6
110,"The resulting distributions can then be fitted using the standard expression() = (4π)[1 + (cos )]. is the angle between the recoil direction and the laser polarization, (cos ) is the second-order Legendre polynomial, and  is the anisotropy parameter.",6
111,"In the limiting case of a single dissociation channel resulting from a pure parallel or perpendicular electronic transition,  is known to take the values +2 or –1, respectively, as long as the dissociation is fast compared to the rotation of the molecules.",1
112,"In the present case, we have an anisotropic ( < 0) distribution (channel A) above an isotropic ( = 0) background (channel B).",1
113,"In order to separate both contributions as well as possible, we integrated the 3D velocity maps by considering only the anisotropic outer shells with  in the range 5000 cm ≤  ≤ 8000 cm.",6
114,The resulting () distributions from reactions (1) and (2d) are presented in Fig. 5.,8
115,The values for the effective asymmetry parameters () which were fitted to these data are given in Table 1.,8
116,The anisotropy parameters for channel A () listed in Table 1 in the last column were then found by correcting  for the relative fractions of the two channels in the integration range.,8
117,The data confirm the assumption of a preferentially perpendicular distribution.,5
118,The H/D velocity maps obtained after excitation of the 1 B (ππ*) state at  = 217 nm in the two-colour experiments and the resulting 3D velocity distributions are depicted in Fig. 6a–c.,8
119,"In principle, the images look similar to those seen before at  = 243 nm.",8
120,"In particular, they exhibit again a sharp, anisotropic outer ring reflecting fast H/D atoms with a narrow speed distribution and a broad, structureless inner feature corresponding to much slower atoms.",8
121,The sharp rings in the H atom image from reaction (1′) in Fig. 6a and the D atom image from reaction (2d′) in Fig. 6b are again attributed to a fast dissociation of the NH/ND bond (referred to in the following as channel A′).,5
122,"Since the excited 1 B (ππ*) state does not correlate directly with H/D + pyrrolyl, this dissociation is assumed to proceed  the lower-lying πσ* state, in accordance with the theoretical predictions.",4
123,The structureless inner signal is again ascribed to unimolecular decay processes in the S state (channel B′).,5
124,"In addition, pyrrole- also leads to H atoms (Fig. 6c, channels B′ and C′).",5
125,A REMPI scan (Fig. 7) gave relative yields of ≈(40 ± 5)% D and ≈(60 ± 5)% H (see discussion).,5
126,The total translational energy distributions () at  = 217 nm are given in Fig. 8.,8
127,The data were fitted in the same way as above; the results are collected in Table 2.,8
128,"Considered on a per bond basis, the direct fission of the NH/ND bond (channel A′) can be seen to remain a major dissociation pathway.",5
129,"However, compared to the results at  = 243 nm, the data at  = 217 nm show significantly higher yields for channel B′.",8
130,"In line with the higher photon energy, the () distributions for both channels A′ and B′ extend to higher translational energies (, higher maxT).",5
131,"At the same time, the distributions are significantly broader.",8
132,"However, the cut-off of channel A′ at maxT is not as well defined at  = 217 nm than at 243 nm.",8
133,"Indeed, the increase of the apparent maxT is smaller than the increase in the photon energies (Δ = 4900 cm).",5
134,"Furthermore, the distributions at the two wavelengths reach their peaks at practically the same energies (peakT).",8
135,These findings are reflected by a correspondingly smaller fraction of the available energy funneled into fragment translation (43% at  = 217 nm compared to 67% at  = 243 nm).,5
136,"Thus, in summary, a higher fraction of the excess energy appears to be deposited in internal degrees of freedom of the pyrrolyl radical.",4
137,"Despite the greater contributions of channel B′, the images at 217 nm show stronger spatial anisotropy than those at 243 nm.",8
138,The angular distributions () from reactions (1′) and (2d′) are presented in Fig. 9.,8
139,The effective asymmetry parameters  and the resulting  values are listed in Table 2.,8
140,The average value of  = –0.95 ± 0.05 is practically equal to the perpendicular limit of  = –1.,5
141,The photodissociation of pyrrole has first been studied by Blank  using photofragment translational spectroscopy (PTS).,1
142,"The authors performed experiments at two fixed wavelengths,  = 248 nm and 193 nm.",1
143,"The reported results for the formation of H atoms at both wavelengths are comparable to those obtained in the present work, although the underlying mechanisms could not be elucidated in detail at the time because of the lack of information on the excited electronic states of pyrrole.",4
144,"However, the PTS results are of interest for this discussion because of the information on the branching ratios of the ensuing channels.",1
145,"At  = 248 nm, H + pyrrolyl were the only observed products.",1
146,"At 193 nm, the authors also observed substantial amounts (≈50%) of products from ring opening reactions.",1
147,"The experimental results presented in this paper demonstrate clearly that the photochemical mechanisms of pyrrole in the near UV can only be rationalized by strong interactions between two excited electronic states in the region, 1 A and 1 B, and the electronic ground state S.",5
148,"The excited states have πσ* and ππ* character, respectively.",5
149,The electronic absorption is dominated by the oscillator strength of the 1 B state ( = 0.209).,5
150,The dipole moment for the excitation from S lies in the molecular plane and perpendicular to the NH bond.,5
151,"The 2 A (ππ*) state, which has been calculated only 0.14 eV below 1 B, also plays some role ( = 0.036).",5
152,"In contrast, the calculated oscillator strength of the 1 A state is negligible.",5
153,"As mentioned, the 1 A state is observed in the UV spectrum only very weakly as a result of vibronic coupling with the neighboring electronically allowed states.",5
154,A schematic diagram of the 1 A (πσ*) and 1 B (ππ*) potential energy surfaces is depicted in Fig. 10.,8
155,The energy profiles were plotted according to the information given by Sobolewski and Domcke.,1
156,Note that the S electronic state itself does not correlate directly with H + pyrrolyl in their electronic ground states.,8
157,The previously reported H atom velocity maps from the photodissociation of pyrrole and -methylpyrrole at  = 243 nm gave the first experimental evidence for the repulsive nature of the 1 A excited electronic state of pyrrole with respect to the NH bond.,1
158,"The experimental observation of very fast H atoms with a narrow and spatially anisotropic velocity distribution (channel A) from pyrrole, but not from -methylpyrrole, was consistent with the theoretical predictions that, as shown in Fig. 10, the NH bond in the first electronic state of pyrrole acquires πσ* character as the bond is stretched.",1
159,"With the detection of very fast D atoms from the photodissociation of pyrrole- with a similar narrow and spatially anisotropic velocity distribution, the present work provides unambiguous evidence for the proposed mechanism.",4
160,"Indeed, the fast direct ND bond fission in pyrrole-  in the 1 A (πσ*) excited electronic state accounts for 90% of the observed D atoms, or, when the H atoms from dissociation of the CH positions are taken into account, 67% of all channels.",5
161,The branching ratio for the direct H detachment in the excited state measured by Blank . is somewhat smaller (47%) than ours (67%).,1
162,"However, at  = 248 nm, the molecules are excited just to the electronic origin of the 1 A state.",5
163,The difference of the branching ratios at 248 and 243 nm can thus be explained by a trapping of the molecules with the lower excitation energy in the shallow potential energy well of the 1 A state that has been found in the  calculations.,4
164,The shapes of the translational energy distributions of the fast H/D atoms in the present work and the study by Blank  are similar (see Table 1).,8
165,The mode-specific nature of the fast NH/ND dissociation process in the 1 A state can be attributed to the unusual properties of the potential energy surface of the state (Fig. 10).,5
166,"In particular, the large potential energy gradient along the NH stretching coordinate (πσ*) provides a strong driving force for a fast, direct cleavage of the NH/ND bond.",5
167,"The conical intersection between the 1 A and S states at  ≈ 1.85 Å then acts as a funnel, through which the H/D atoms are expelled with very high kinetic energies.",5
168,This occurs on a time scale before IC to S and intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) may compete.,5
169,"From the spatial anisotropy parameter ( ≈ –0.45, Table 1), we have to conclude in any case that the dissociation lifetime of the excited molecules is comparable to or even shorter than their rotational period.",4
170,"The electronic excitation is seen to be preferentially perpendicular, as we would expect for a vibronic coupling of the 1 A to the 1 B state.",5
171,"However, there may also be contribution from vibronic coupling to the 2 A state, which can be reached from S a parallel transition.",7
172,"Thus, the  value could arise from a mixture of the two states.",4
173,"In the limiting case of a very fast dissociation with  = –1 for the perpendicular (1 B) and  = +2 for the parallel (2 A) branch, this would imply a ratio of 82∶18% for the two states.",5
174,"Incidentally, this is close to the ratio of the oscillator strengths.",1
175,"Obviously, some caution with these considerations is advisable because of a possible short trapping of the molecules in the 1 A state.",1
176,"We note nevertheless that in the case of the direct excitation of the 1 B state at  = 217 nm, we have  = –0.95 ± 0.05 (Table 2), practically equal to the perpendicular limit, even though in this case the excited molecules have to pass through another conical intersection (from 1 B to the πσ* state) before the subsequent dissociation on the πσ* potential surface.",5
177,"Considering the data for pyrrole- (reaction (2)), a fraction of 33% of the H/D atoms appears to be produced  different other mechanisms.",5
178,IC from the 1 A to the S electronic state is the first process that comes to mind.,7
179,This radiationless electronic transition is likely mediated by the same conical intersection that is responsible for the fast NH/ND bond dissociation ( Fig. 10).,1
180,"The intersection arises due to a vibrational mode of  symmetry, which corresponds to a screwing of the aromatic ring.",1
181,H/D atoms can then be produced from the resulting vibrationally hot S molecules  a variety of unimolecular decay processes (channel B).,1
182,The unimolecular dissociation of pyrrole in the electronic ground state has been studied experimentally by shock tube pyrolysis measurements and theoretically by quantum chemical techniques and chemical kinetic modeling.,3
183,"The major decomposition products were found to be HCN, methylacetylene, and acetylene, besides numerous other products appearing in smaller quantities.",1
184,The complete mechanism that has been developed includes ≈200 elementary reactions so that a detailed discussion exceeds the scope of the present paper.,1
185,The lowest energy dissociation channel was found to proceed  an H atom migration to pyrrolenine (2H-pyrrole) followed by decomposition to HCN and CHCCH.,1
186,"From the measurements of Blank . who probed the molecules at almost the same excitation energy ( = 248 nm), we know that these products do not seem play a role here.",8
187,There is also a possibility for an isomerization to -crotonitrile or vinylacetonitrile.,7
188,H + pyrrolyl are formed preferentially by the dissociation of the CH group in the pyrrolenine intermediate rather than by direct NH bond fission.,1
189,"In this case, between one third and one half of the H atoms should originate from the NH position, the other two thirds to one half should originate from the CH positions, in line with the experimental results for reaction (2).",1
190,"In addition, there are several other pathways to H atoms, including some that are connected with ring opening processes.",1
191,"These atoms are expected to be produced with, essentially, statistical translational energy distributions.",1
192,"Since the complex sequential unimolecular reactions of the molecules in the S state are not the main topic at this Discussion on non-adiabatic effects, we will not consider them in further detail.",1
193,"Surprisingly, the photodissociation of pyrrole- also seems to produce a small amount (≈10%) of fast H atoms (referred to above as channel C) with a similar velocity distribution as the D atoms from channel A (Table 1).",8
194,"While it is difficult to rule out an experimental artifact by a D/H exchange in the molecules in the gas supply line between the reservoir and the molecular beam valve, it is noted that the results were reproducible from day to day and did not seem to depend on the length of time the system was treated with DO.",8
195,A similar channel has also been noted by Blank,1
196,"Thus, we are tempted to postulate either a small contribution from a direct dissociation of one of the CH bonds in the excited 1 A state or a fast partial intramolecular exchange in the excited state before the NH dissociation on the repulsive 1 A potential energy surface.",4
197,Both processes should be investigated by additional theoretical calculations.,1
198,"However, a fast D/H isotope exchange would also explain the observations.",1
199,The NH bond dissociation energy of the pyrrole molecule is of fundamental importance for estimating the thermal stability of the molecule in combustion processes.,2
200,The present study can be considered as the most direct experimental determination to date.,1
201,The value of 00(NH) = (31 000 ± 500) cm is in excellent agreement with that given by Blank,5
202,(00 = 30 800 cm) and slightly lower that the  quantum chemical estimate of 33 180 cm reported by Bacskay,5
203,The discrepancy to our earlier report stems from the recalibration of the velocity map images based on the photodissociation HBr and HI.,1
204,The difference between the values of 00(NH) and 00(ND) is somewhat smaller than the expected isotope effect and not unreasonable considering the error limits.,5
205,The accuracy of the present data is limited essentially only by the resolution of the images.,1
206,"The experimental results after excitation of the 1 B (ππ*) state at  = 217 nm show that a large fraction of the excited molecules decay again by a fast detachment of the H atom from the NH position, although the excited state is bound with respect to the NH coordinate (Fig. 10).",5
207,"As shown in Fig. 10, the geometry-optimized 1 B (ππ*) state lies slightly above the optimized 1 A (πσ*) state.",8
208,"In a multi-dimensional picture, both are connected by a surface of intersection.",1
209,Vibrational modes of b symmetry lift the degeneracies and lead to a conical intersection that can promote an efficient ultrafast radiationless transition from the 1 B to the 1 A surface.,1
210,The subsequent dynamics is thus controlled by the πσ* potential surface.,1
211,"In particular, the πσ* nature of the state leads to the same ultrafast NH bond dissociation and formation of H + pyrrolyl as observed before at  = 243 nm.",1
212,Thus the experimental results for the observed channel A′ can be rationalized by a fast predissociation of the 1 B.,4
213,"From the anisotropy parameter of  = –0.95, we have to conclude that this occurs on an ultrafast timescale ( ≲ 300 fs).",4
214,The translational energy distributions resulting from the predissociation of the 1 B state at  = 217 nm are remarkably similar to those observed from the 1 A state at  = 243 nm.,5
215,"In particular, the peak energies (peakT) are practically identical, despite of the higher photon energy at 217 nm, which increases  by ≈4900 cm.",8
216,"This picture is extended by the results at  = 193 nm, where the addition of another 5700 cm to  raises peakT by just a few hundred cm.",1
217,The only effect of the increase of  at the higher photon energies is a slight increase of the widths of the () distributions.,8
218,"As suggested by Fig. 10, only the NH stretching vibration can lead to a high translational energy release.",4
219,"Obviously, the extra energy cannot be released as translational energy and remains in the pyrrolyl radical as internal energy.",4
220,The almost identical peakT values at the different excitation wavelengths thus show that the coupling between the reaction coordinate (NH stretching motion) and the other nuclear coordinates during the fast decay on the 1 A surface is almost negligible.,4
221,The geometries of the molecule at the conical intersection between the 1 B and the 1 A state are suggested to be very different compared to the equilibrium configuration.,4
222,"As in the experiments at  = 243 nm, the formation of the slow H/D atoms with a broad translational energy distribution (channel B′) is attributed to an electronic relaxation to the S state followed by unimolecular dissociation.",5
223,A comparison of Tables 1 and 2 shows that this pathway is more important at  = 217 nm than at 243 nm.,5
224,"The higher fraction of channel B′ can be rationalized by two decay processes, direct relaxation from the 1 B to the S state and relaxation  the 1 A state.",5
225,The additional internal energy from the higher photon energy may be responsible for the more efficient relaxation to S.,5
226,It also leads to a faster unimolecular decomposition of the S state.,5
227,Products from ring opening reactions have not been detected in the present work.,1
228,"At  = 193 nm, however, Blank  observed ≈50% of HCN + CH.",1
229,"In addition, there is again a small fraction of fast H atoms from the photodissociation of pyrrole- (see above).",5
230,The photodissociation of pyrrole in the 1 A (πσ*) first excited electronic state at  = 243 nm and in the higher lying 1 B (ππ*) electronic state at  = 217 nm has been studied by photofragment velocity map imaging.,9
231,The results show that the dynamics differ strikingly from the unimolecular decomposition of the molecules in the electronic ground state.,5
232,"The 1 A state decays mainly  fast mode-specific NH bond fission, which is driven by the repulsive nature of the πσ* potential energy surface along the NH stretching coordinate.",5
233,The H atoms are therefore eliminated with very high kinetic energy close to the maximum available energy.,5
234,"In addition, the 1 A state can undergo a fast IC to the electronic ground state followed by unimolecular decay of the vibrationally highly excited S molecules.",5
235,The 1 B state is predissociated by the πσ* state.,5
236,"Thus, it exhibits the same fast mode-specific NH bond fission channel.",5
237,"However, IC to S and subsequent unimolecular decomposition plays a larger role.",5
238,The highly efficient radiationless electronic transitions from the ππ* to the πσ* state and from the πσ* to the S state are mediated by conical intersections between the respective potential energy surfaces.,5
239,"From the strongly anisotropic angular H atom distributions, the lifetimes of the excited electronic states are short compared to the rotational period of the molecules.",5
240,Minor additional pathways which need further investigation may be a direct CH dissociation and/or a fast exchange between the NH and CH positions in the excited electronic state(s).,5
241,The radiationless decay mechanisms established in the present work for pyrrole are of substantial interest for the ongoing discussion of the photochemical dynamics of the nucleic acid bases.,4
242,"In particlar, the purine bases are known to show a low-lying threshold, above which the excited states are abruptly quenched.",1
243,It is currently a matter of controversy whether this quenching is due to a ππ*–nπ* coupling or to the suggested ultrafast NH/OH predissociation  the πσ* mechanism.,1
244,The πσ* mechanism may also play a role in excited state intramolecular hydrogen transfer (ESIHT) processes.,1
245,"Furthermore, it has even been proposed to lead a fast NC bond fission in electronically excited -methylpyrrole.",1
0,Stabilization of an excess electron on uracil by water.  study,9
1,Experiments performed on the uracil anion in the gaseous phase indicated that in this system the excess electron is dipole-bound.,5
2,"The experiments, however, also indicated that water solvation changes the character of the anion from dipole-bound to covalent.",5
3,In this work we have used  theoretical calculations to investigate the stabilization effect that the attachment of one or two water molecules has on the electron attached to uracil.,0
4,The calculations concern both dipole-bound and covalently-bound electrons and reveal rich configurational isomerism of the complex of the uracil anion with HO molecules.,5
5,The systems differ in terms of the structure of the solvation cluster formed around the excess electron.,1
6,The existence of the dipole-bound anion of uracil was first predicted theoretically in our group and subsequently detected in gas phase experiments by the groups of Schermann and Bowen.,1
7,Subsequent experiments concerning anion formation of hydrated molecules of nucleic acid bases showed that hydration changes the nature of the complex with an excess electron anion and converts the very weakly-dipole-bound uracil anion to a more stable conventional covalent anion.,1
8,The photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) showed very different spectral signatures of the two anions.,3
9,"While for the former a sharp narrow peak at 93 ± 7 meV was observed, the latter produced a broad feature characteristic to a covalent anion.",1
10,The broad feature did not show any vibrational structure and was noticeably shifted towards higher electron binding energies than the feature corresponding to the dipole-bound anion of the monomer.,1
11,The stabilization of an excess electron attached to a closed-shell system by solvating the anion with polar molecules is an effect that can be easily understood based on the analysis of the electrostatic interactions occurring between the excess electron and the solvating systems.,1
12,"The transformation of a dipole-bound anion to a covalent anion upon solvation, however, may also involve, apart from the stabilization of the excess electron by the direct interaction with solvating systems, an additional effect resulting from the structural conformation of the solvated covalent anion being more stable than the conformation of the solvated dipole-bound anion.",1
13,Our previous calculations of the covalent electron attachment to uracil indicated that such an attachment causes a puckering distortion of the uracil ring.,1
14,"If solvation stabilizes the puckered uracil structure more than the planar structure of the uracil dipole-bound anion, the covalent anion may become more stable.",1
15,The additional stabilization due to solvation may also result from a stronger interaction of the solvent with the more localized covalently-attached excess electron than with the much more diffused dipole-bound electron.,1
16,"In this work, we study the solvation of the excess electron in uracil anion by one and two water molecules.",9
17,We only consider structures where at least one water molecule is in direct contact with the electron.,3
18,"For the [uracil]·water complex, we have already studied one such configuration where the dipole-bound excess electron of uracil was localized between the uracil molecule and the water molecule.",1
19,"We showed that such a configuration is stable, the presence of water stabilizes the dipole-bound excess electron and makes it more localized.",1
20,"In the present work, we study the stabilization of an excess electron covalently attached to a uracil molecule by a water molecule.",9
21,We also consider the stabilization effects on a dipole-bound and a covalently-bound excess electron in the uracil anion by two water molecules.,9
22,"Trapping excess electrons in molecules and clusters either by fields of dipoles, higher multipoles or in covalent states, is a phenomenon with relevance to fundamental properties of molecular systems.",2
23,An electron trapped in a localized bound state of the system may significantly affect its chemical and physical properties.,2
24,It is also interesting to investigate structures of possible molecular electron traps formed by molecular complexes.,1
25,"For example, electron trapping is relevant to molecular charge conductivity and charge localization in such systems as DNA and other biopolymers.",1
26,"In this work, we consider enhancement of the uracil ability to bind an excess electron resulting from direct interaction of the electron with water molecules.",9
27,"In particular, the calculations performed here show a rich conformational topology of the uracil·(HO)·e system and describe the magnitude of the electron stabilization effects resulting from the solvation.",4
28,All the calculations in this work have been performed using the Gaussian98 program package.,3
29,"The spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted Hartree–Fock (RHF and UHF) methods were used for neutral systems and anions, respectively.",3
30,"For all systems, the structure optimizations have been performed using the second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2).",3
31,All structures reported in this work are available  e-mail from the corresponding author upon request.,1
32,In the first series of calculations we considered stabilization of a covalent uracil anion by a water molecule.,9
33,We only searched for a structure where water was directly interacting with its hydrogens with the excess electron.,6
34,"Thus, the structure optimization of the system performed at the UMP2/aug-cc-pvdz level of theory was initiated with a puckered structure of uracil with a water molecule suspended above the uracil ring.",6
35,This calculation converged to a structure shown in Fig. 1.,8
36,In the figure we also show the UHF orbital occupied by the excess electron in this system.,8
37,"One can notice that, as expected, the excess electron is covalently attached to uracil in a π-state and the water molecule directly interacts with the electron and does not form hydrogen bonds with the uracil molecule.",5
38,These features differentiate the structure found here from the structure of the uracil·HO anion described by Dolgounitcheva,1
39,In their structure the water molecule had an in-plane hydrogen bond to one of the oxygens in uracil and its contact with the π excess electron was reduced.,1
40,"Next, the electron binding energy in the anion was determined with respect to the neutral complex with the same geometry as the uracil·HO anion (the vertical electron detachment energy, VDE) and with respect to the equilibrium geometry of the neutral complex obtained in the MP2/aug-cc-pvdz optimization (the adiabatic electron detachment energy, ADE).",6
41,This optimization was initiated with the geometry of the anion and the optimized H-bonded structure of the uracil·HO complex is shown in Fig. 2.,8
42,"The calculations of the VDE and ADE were performed at the MP2/aug-cc-pvdz//MP2/aug-cc-pvdz, MP2/aug-cc-pvtz//MP2/aug-cc-pvdz (except for VDE), and MP4/6-31++G**//MP2/aug-cc-pvdz levels of theory and the results are shown in Table 1.",6
43,This was performed to determine how these quantities change when the basis set is increased and when the level of theory is enhanced.,0
44,"As one can see from the results, the VDE values are all positive and they increase slightly in going from the 6-31++G** basis to the aug-cc-pvdz basis.",8
45,Moving from the MP2 to the MP4 level of theory has very little effect on VDE and ADE.,8
46,"The ADE values are all negative indicating that the covalent anion is a metastable system, less stable than the neutral complex.",5
47,"Based on the MP2 energies obtained with the different basis sets, which seems to be converging to a value around −0.2 eV and based on the very small reduction of ADE due to inclusion of higher order effects of 0.04 eV, it is unlikely that the anion can become more stable than the neutral system.",5
48,There are a number of ways an excess electron attached to a uracil molecule can interact with two HO molecules.,1
49,Both the dipole-bound σ excess electron and the covalently attached π-electron have to be considered as possible targets of hydration since in both cases the stabilization effect of hydration should render the excess electrons more strongly attached to the uracil moiety.,1
50,One can envision the following configurations of the two HO molecules interacting with the dipole-bound excess electron of the uracil anion: a configuration where both waters point the positive ends of their dipoles at the electron; a configuration where an HO dimer points its dipole at the excess electron; a configuration where the excess electron is dipole-bound to the complex of uracil with a water molecule and is solvated by the other water; and a configuration where an HO dimer is H-bonded to uracil and at the same time solvates the dipole-bound electron of uracil.,1
51,"An electron covalently attached to a uracil molecule in a π-state can be hydrated by two water molecules in the following ways: two waters can approach uracil perpendicularly to its ring, one on each side of the ring; two waters can independently approach the excess electron from one side of the ring; a water dimer can approach the electron perpendicularly to the uracil ring.",1
52,"There are, perhaps, some other possibilities.",1
53,In the first series of calculations we have explored the topology of the uracil·(HO)·e anion by performing geometry optimizations of the system and initiating them with different initial geometries of the complex reflecting the structural isomerism described above.,0
54,The optimizations for the anions with two waters solvating the dipole-bound excess electron of uracil were performed at the UMP2 level of theory with the 6-31++G** basis set augmented with additional diffuse orbitals placed at the hydrogen of uracil located the closest to the positive pole of the uracil dipole.,6
55,"The additional diffuse orbitals included six gaussian sp-shells with exponents 0.01, 0.002, 0.0004, 0.00008, 0.000016, and 0.0000032 and a p-subshell with the exponent 0.036.",6
56,In our previous studies we have determined that this set of additional orbitals should be sufficient to describe the ground states of the dipole-bound excess electron in systems with dipole moments similar to the dipole moments of the complexes considered in the present work.,1
57,"By including gaussians with very small exponents in the basis we allowed the excess electron to escape from the system, if such a process would lower the system's total energy.",1
58,"Thus, the possibility that the excess electron stays confined to the system due to an overly confining orbital basis and not due to higher stability of the anion than the neutral cluster is eliminated.",1
59,The augmented 6-31++G** basis will be called 6-31++G**X in the discussion that follows.,6
60,The geometry optimizations of the hydrated covalent uracil anion with the excess electron occupying a π state was first performed at the UMP2/6-31++G** level of theory and then the structures were refined with the use of the UMP2/aug-cc-pvdz level.,6
61,"The geometry optimizations produced five different uracil·(HO)·e structures (A, B, C, D, and E) corresponding to minima on the potential energy surface of the anion.",8
62,The structures are shown in Fig. 3.,8
63,"In Fig. 4 we show the orbitals occupied by the excess electrons in these systems and in Table 2 we present their total UMP2 energies and their vertical electron detachment energies (VDE) calculated by subtracting the energy of the neutral cluster determined at the geometry of the anion (at the MP2/6-31++G**X level for A and B, and at the MP2/aug-cc-pvdz level for C, D, and E) from the anion energy.",6
64,The calculated VDEs of 0.45 eV for A and 0.43 eV for B indicate that the hydration stabilizes the excess electrons in these systems.,5
65,By examining the orbitals of the first two anions one can notice that for both systems we have the case of the two H-bonded water molecules solvating the uracil dipole-bound electron.,5
66,"The difference in the systems, which is reflected in the total energy for A being slightly higher than for B, is a hydrogen bond between the uracil and the water dimer that exists in B, but is not present in A.",5
67,Anions C–E are different from anions A and B. Here the excess electron occupies a π-orbital of uracil and is solvated by waters approaching the uracil from axial directions.,8
68,"As mentioned before, in the covalent anion of uracil its ring is noticeably puckered.",1
69,This puckering does not disappear upon hydration which is apparent in the structures of the C–E anions shown in Fig. 3.,8
70,"In anion C, the two HO molecules are positioned on opposite sides of the uracil ring and in anions D and E they are located on the same side.",8
71,In all three configurations the ring puckering is enforced and the stabilization of the excess electron in the π-state is enhanced.,8
72,"For all three anions with a covalently attached excess electron, the VDE values are much larger than for anions A and B. They are 1.21 eV for anion C, 1.24 eV for anion D, and 1.18 eV for anion E. In this group anion E is slightly more stable than the other two.",5
73,"There are some common structural features in anions C, D, and E. In all three systems, one of the water molecules is positioned exactly above the uracil ring with one of its hydrogens pointing at N3 and the other pointing at C6.",8
74,The position of the second water molecule is what differentiates the three structures; in C the second water is located on the other side of the ring with respect to the first water and in D and E the second water is H-bonded to the first one.,8
75,"However, in all three anions, one of the hydrogens of the second water molecule always points at one of the uracil oxygen atoms and it is involved in a H-bond interaction with that atom.",8
76,"Thus, in anions D and E, a cyclic structure is formed involving the water molecule linked with its hydrogens to the π-attached uracil excess electron, and the second water molecule which forms a bridge between the first water and an oxygen atom of uracil.",5
77,"Finally, in the last series of calculations, geometry optimizations were performed for the neutral uracil·(HO) cluster.",9
78,"This system has been considered in a number of works including, for example, recent studies by van Mourik and Gadre",1
79,"Since the optimizations of the uracil·(HO) cluster in the present calculations were only initiated with the geometries of the A–E anions, the equilibrium structures found do not describe the complete topology of the uracil·(HO) potential energy surface.",1
80,"The “A,B”–initiated optimizations carried out at the MP2/6-31++G**X level converged to a single structure shown in Fig. 5 (structure A).",6
81,This appears to be the global minimum on the uracil·(HO) potential energy surface.,5
82,"The optimizations initiated with the geometries of anions C, D and E and carried out at the MP2/aug-cc-pvdz level converged to structures B, C and D, respectively.",6
83,"In A, the two HO molecules and the uracil molecule form a cyclic hydrogen-bonded structure with three H-bonds.",8
84,"In B, the two waters are separated and are H-bonded to uracil at opposite sides.",8
85,"In C, the waters form a dimer which is H-bonded to uracil and only one water molecule is involved in this bond.",8
86,"In D, the waters also form a dimer which is positioned above the uracil ring and interacts with π-electrons of the uracil.",8
87,"The comparison of the total energy of the A uracil·(HO) neutral cluster provided in Table 2 with the energies of anions A and B shows that the neutral system is more stable than any of the two anions by 0.49 and 0.30 eV, respectively.",5
88,"Also, the energy of anion C is higher than the energy of the B uracil·(HO) cluster by 0.10 eV.",5
89,"However, the relative stability order is reversed for anions D and E. These systems are more stable than the neutral uracil·(HO) clusters with the equilibrium geometries obtained in the optimizations initiated with the geometries of the two anions.",5
90,"Since the structures of anions A and B and the structure of the neutral cluster are dissimilar, the relative stability determination as the difference of the total energies may be subject to the basis set superposition error (BSSE).",4
91,"The same effect, however, probably smaller, may also occur for anions C, D, and E. To verify this point a series of calculations were carried out to estimate the magnitude of this error in the determination of the ADE energy for anion A where dipole-bound uracil electron is solvated and for anion C where a covalently-attached excess electron of uracil is subject to solvation.",0
92,Two series of three calculations were undertaken for each of the two systems.,1
93,In the first series we considered an isolated uracil molecule and each of the two waters and the calculations were undertaken in the basis set of the whole anion and in the second series the calculations for the three systems were repeated in the basis set of each individual molecule.,3
94,For calculations pertaining to anion A we used the MP2/6-31++G**X level of theory and for those pertaining to anion C we used the MP2/aug-cc-pvdz level.,6
95,The difference of the energies obtained in this way for each of the three systems ( uracil and two waters) provided an estimation of how much each system is stabilized by calculating it in the basis set of the cluster  calculating it in its own basis.,3
96,The total stabilization effect was obtained by summing up the contributions obtained for the three systems.,3
97,"A similar series of calculations was also performed for the equilibrium geometries of the A and B neutral uracil·(HO) clusters and the basis-set stabilization effect determined for these systems was subtracted from the corresponding stabilization energies obtained for anions A and C. In this way, the corrections that need to be added to the ADE values of anions A and C to approximately compensate for the BSSEs were determined.",3
98,"In the above approach we assumed that the basis set effect does not change much in moving from the anion to the neutral system and, thus all the above calculations could be performed for the neutral forms of the molecules forming anions A and C.",1
99,"Since in the neutral equilibrium uracil·(HO)A cluster the three molecules are closer together than in anion A, we anticipated a larger basis-set related stabilization effect for the former than for the latter system.",7
100,This was indeed confirmed by the calculations which yielded a value of 0.14 eV for the difference of the two basis-set stabilization effects in favour of the neutral cluster ( the neutral cluster was more stabilized than the anion by the molecules forming the cluster using the basis functions of the partner molecules to lower their energies).,5
101,"Thus, in order to correct the ADE for anion A the value 0.14 eV should be added to the value −0.49 eV obtained without the BSSE correction.",5
102,"Although this changes the ADE somewhat, it still remains negative indicating metastability of the anion with respect to the neutral cluster.",5
103,For anion C one can expect that the basis set effect should also reduce the magnitude of the ADE but to a much lesser degree than for anion A because the intermolecular distances in C and its corresponding neutral cluster (B) are not as different as they are in A and its neutral counterpart (A).,7
104,Again the calculations confirmed the anticipated trend and gave the value of only 0.02 eV for the basis-set related stabilization effect in this case.,5
105,This value should be added to the value −0.10 eV obtained without the BSSE correction.,5
106,Again in this case the correction does not reverse the stability order of the anion and the neutral cluster.,5
107,The calculations performed in this work describe an interesting topology of the configurational space of the anion consisting of a uracil molecule and one and two HO molecules.,1
108,"We have only considered structures where either one or both waters are in direct contact with the excess electron attached to the uracil, and for the anion involving a single water molecule we only considered a structure with a covalently attached electron in a π-state because the other isomers of this system had been studied before.",1
109,In all the considered systems the interaction of the HO molecules with the dipole-bound or covalently-bound excess electron significantly enhances the bonding of the electron.,5
110,"Also, the state of the excess electron becomes more localized.",5
111,The uracil·(HO) system is an interesting model of an electron trap formed by clusters of polar molecules.,1
112,It is evident that an excess electron attached to a molecule can be solvated through direct contact with polar molecules of the solvent.,4
113,"The solvation cluster formed around the electron can accommodate more than one molecule and may have different configurations which, in addition to the direct links of the systems forming the cluster to the electron, may also involve inter-system links.",4
114,"Most of the anions studied in in this work, though quite stable with respect to removal of the excess electron without geometry relaxation, are metastable with respect to the neutral clusters at their equilibrium geometries.",5
115,Only two uracil·(HO) anions (anions D and E) are both “vertically” and “adiabatically” stable.,5
116,Here the adiabatic stability corresponds to the energy of the anion being lower than the energy of the neutral complex with the equilibrium structure obtained in the geometry optimization initiated with the geometry of the anion (not with regard to the lowest energy structure).,4
117,This is the first time such anions have been predicted for the uracil·(HO) system using  calculations.,4
118,The hydrated uracil·HO·e and uracil·(HO)·e systems described in the calculations performed in this work may be the covalent anions of uracil·water clusters observed in the experiments.,4
119,We hope the present calculations will inspire further experimental attempts to study the configurational isomerism of anions of hydrated uracil in the gas phase.,1
0,Theoretical study on the coplanar double-cage dodecahedrane CH,9
1,"Using geometry optimization and DFT method at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory for CH, an equilibrium geometry is identified that has the form of a coplanar double-cage dodecahedrane.",5
2,Vibrational frequencies and the IR spectrum are computed at the same level of theory.,9
3,The heat of formation for CH has been estimated in this paper.,9
4,The heat of formation of CH as well as the vibrational analysis indicates that this system enjoys sufficient stability to allow for its experimental preparation.,4
5,"Since the discovery of C in 1985, numerous papers have been published on the investigation of polyhedral molecules, such as fullerenes and polyhedral hydrocarbons.",1
6,"Each of these molecules has only one cage, for example C and dodecahedrane.",1
7,"As is known, every carbon atom can form four bonds with other atoms.",1
8,"Since each of the carbon atoms at the cage surface of the polyhedral molecule only forms three bonds with other carbon atoms at the cage surface, it may form another bond with other atom.",1
9,"When two cages share a same polygon, a coplanar double-cage molecule can form.",1
10,This is similar to two benzene rings sharing one CC bond to form a naphthalene molecule.,1
11,"However, until now, only a few coplanar poly-cage molecules have been reported.",1
12,It has been stated that “the dodecahedrane geometry is exquisite in its perfection”.,1
13,"The two landmark syntheses of dodecahedrane, by Paquette and by Prinzbach and Weber, were of great interest.",1
14,"Owing to its unusual structure, dodecahedrane has also provided theorists with a severe test case for the calculation of geometry and properties.",1
15,"These include assessments of its vibrational frequencies, ordering of orbital energies, formation of inclusion compounds, NMR spin–spin coupling constants, and heat of formation.",3
16,"When two dodecahedrane cages share a same pentagon, a coplanar double-cage dodecahedrane molecule CH can form.",1
17,"In this case, every carbon atom at the shared polygon forms four bonds with other carbon atoms.",1
18,"To the best of our knowledge, the coplanar double-cage dodecahedrane CH molecule has not been reported before.",2
19,This paper is a theoretical attempt to study CH by using the DFT method at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.,9
20,"For the sake of understanding the thermodynamic stability of CH, the heat of formation Δ0f of CH was estimated according to the calculated energy change for the process:and the experimental heat of formation for dodecahedrane CH.",0
21,"Δ0f of CH is 51.3 kcal mol, it is larger than that of dodecahedrane, but smaller than that of the cubane CH.",5
22,Thus we believe that CH has sufficient stability to allow its experimental preparation.,4
23,The predicted structure of molecule CH is shown in Fig. 1.,5
24,The full geometry optimization was performed by the energy gradient method at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory with the GAUSSIAN 94 program system.,3
25,In the starting geometry of optimization for CH it was assumed that each C cage in the CH molecule is similar to that of dodecahedrane.,6
26,"To summarize, the length of the carbon–carbon bonds is 1.54 Å and that of carbon–hydrogen bonds is 1.09 Å, the CCC angle is 108° and the CCH angle is 110.9°.",6
27,"In the optimization, the symmetry was restricted to .",6
28,"Vibrational frequencies were determined first to verify the nature of the stationary point structure, second to examine zero-point energy corrections on calculating the heat of formation of the molecule, and third to predict vibrational frequencies for unknown stable species for the sake of their future experimental identification by IR spectroscopy and the assignment of the observed frequencies.",9
29,"For the sake of comparison, the geometry of dodecahedrane CH was first optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.",3
30,"The bond length of C–C is 1.556 Å and that of C–H is 1.096 Å, respectively.",5
31,"The bond length of C–C is slightly larger than the experimental range of C–C bond lengths, 1.535–1.541 Å, reported for the X-ray structure.",8
32,The bond angle of CCC is 108° and the HCC angle is 110.9°.,5
33,The geometry of CH optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level is shown in Table 1 with the numbered system of carbon and hydrogen atoms given in Fig. 1.,8
34,Net atomic charges of CH obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory are listed in Table 2 and those of dodecahedrane are also given in Table 2 for the sake of comparison.,8
35,All hydrogen atoms of CH have positive net charges and values very close to that of dodecahedrane.,5
36,"As for carbon atoms, only at shared pentagon do they have positive charges, while the others have negative charges.",5
37,Some other properties of CH obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory are listed in Table 3 and those of dodecahedrane also listed here.,8
38,"The energies of the HOMO and LUMO of CH at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory are −6.91 and 0.86 eV, respectively.",5
39,The HOMO is doubly degenerate and the LUMO is non-degenerate.,4
40,"The energies of the HOMO and LUMO for dodecahedrane at the same level of theory are −7.09 and 0.89 eV, respectively.",5
41,A large HOMO–LUMO gap has long been recognized as being correlated with kinetic and structural stability while a small gap is associated with reactivity.,1
42,"The HOMO–LUMO gaps of CH and dodecahedrane are 7.77 and 7.99 eV, respectively.",5
43,"This illustrates that CH is more likely to react by electron donation than dodecahedrane, and is more likely to react by accepting electrons than dodecahedrane.",4
44,Thus the stability of CH is lower than that of dodecahedrane.,4
45,"In order to verify whether CH is a minimum at the potential energy hypersurface or not, vibrational frequencies have been calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.",0
46,The predicted vibrational frequencies for CH are listed in Table 4.,8
47,Vibrational frequencies in Table 4 are not scaled.,8
48,"From Table 4, it can be seen that the molecule CH has no imaginary vibrational frequency and is a true minimum at the potential energy hypersurface.",5
49,The symmetry of CH is helpful in making the assignments.,1
50,"Decomposition of the reducible representation of vibrational degrees of freedom assuming the  point group, gives  = 13a′(R) + 6a″ + 19e′(IR) + 18e″ + 6a′ + 12a″(IR) + 20e′(R) + 19e″of which the a′, a″, e″, a′, e′ and e″ normal modes are IR forbidden by symmetry and their IR intensities are identically zero.",5
51,"The other modes e′ and a″ are IR active, but many theoretical IR intensities of these modes are smaller than 1.0 km mol.",5
52,The modes a′ and a″ are Raman active.,5
53,As is well known quantum-chemical methods tend to overestimate the values of vibrational frequencies.,1
54,"For dodecahedrane, the experimental values of IR allowed frequencies (symmetry t) are 728, 1298 and 2945 cm, but those obtained here at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory are 732.4, 1350.6 and 3091.8 cm; the experimental values of Raman allowed frequencies (symmetry a and h) are 480, 676, 840, 1092, 1164, 1324, 2938 and 2954 cm, and those obtained here at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory are 481.7, 674.0, 854.5, 1114.7, 1203.6, 1376.5, 3077.0 and 3105.2 cm.",5
55,"Comparing the experimental values  and the B3LYP/6-31G* theoretical values  of vibrational frequencies for dodecahedrane, the differences between  and  at different frequency ranges are different.",5
56,Scaling factors for the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory have been estimated by using the experimental and theoretical vibrational frequencies for dodecahedrane given above.,6
57,"When vibrational frequencies are <1000 cm, the average scaling factor is 0.9941; when vibrational frequencies are in the range of 1000–2000 cm, the average scaling factor is 0.9674; when vibrational frequencies are in the range of 2000–4000 cm, the average scaling factor is 0.9529.",5
58,"According to vibrational frequencies in Table 4 and the average scaling factors given above, the IR spectrum of CH has been simulated and reported in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.",3
59,"In Fig. 2, the IR allowed vibrational frequencies are in the range of 600–1400 cm; in Fig. 3, the IR allowed vibrational frequencies are in the range of 2880–2980 cm.",8
60,"In the other ranges, vibrational frequencies are not IR active or the IR intensities are zero.",8
61,The simulated IR spectrum can be used as evidence to identify the molecule CH.,4
62,What is the stability of the molecule CH?,1
63,"In order to answer this, the approach to a theoretical estimate for the heat of formation Δof of the molecule CH is presented here.",0
64,"First, the energy change Δ for reaction (1):was estimated by using the total energy  and the ZPE for CH, dodecahedrane and H at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.",6
65,"The values of  and ZPE for CH and dodecahedrane are given in Table 3, and those for H are −1.17548 au and 6.4 kcal mol, respectively.",5
66,The energy change Δ of the reaction (1) was calculated as follows:,6
67,"When the energy change Δ of the reaction (1) and the heat of formation Δof for CH and H are known, the heat of formation Δof for CH can be estimated according to reaction (1).",6
68,"The result is as follows: The experimental heat of formation Δof for CH and H are 18.2 kcal mol, and zero, respectively.",5
69,The energy change Δ of the reaction (1) has been calculated above.,3
70,Thus Δof for the molecule CH can be estimated as follows: The estimated heat of formation for the molecule CH is 51.2 kcal mol.,5
71,"This is larger than that of dodecahedrane, but smaller than that of cubane, 148.7 kcal mol.",8
72,"So, purely from the thermodynamic point of view the coplanar double-cage dodecahedrane molecule CH is more stable than cubane CH.",4
73,"Since cubane has been synthesized, CH has sufficient stability to allow its experimental preparation.",4
74,The thermodynamically stable geometry of the coplanar double-cage dodecahedrane molecule CH was optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory; its structure is of  symmetry.,3
75,"According to heat of formation of the molecule estimated here, CH is more stable than cubane.",5
76,"Since cubane has been synthesized, CH should have sufficient stability to allow its experimental preparation.",4
77,"The coplanar double-cage dodecahedrane molecule CH is a molecule with only one type of cage, a C cage.",1
78,We believe that coplanar poly-cage molecules could form with the same or different kind of cages.,7
79,A coplanar double-cage molecule CH with different cages is shown in Fig. 4.,1
80,The variety of coplanar poly-cage molecules of hydrocarbons is large.,1
81,"If coplanar poly-cage hydrocarbons could be prepared, the number of polyhedral hydrocarbons might be increased substantially.",4
0,Discrimination between neurochemical and macromolecular signals in human frontal lobes using short echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy,3
1,"Magnetic resonance spectra from large (35 cm) frontal lobe voxels  were analyzed using LCModel, with and without subtraction of a “metabolite nulled” spectrum with an inversion time of 650 ms to characterize the macromolecule baseline.",3
2,"Baseline subtraction decreased the signal to noise ratio (SNR), but improved the reliability of LCModel quantification of most metabolites, as reflected in the Cramer–Rao lower bounds, in particular for glutamate and glutamine.",8
3,"The reported concentrations increased for glutamine, creatine, and lactate, and decreased for glutamate, myo-inositol and NAAG, but the sum of all metabolites remained constant, as did the standard deviation of the concentrations in the control group.",5
4,"Macromolecule subtraction is worthwhile when SNR is high, as in the characterization of normal-appearing tissue in the brain.",4
5,Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy can estimate the  concentration of several important chemicals in the brain.,3
6,"Most studies to date have been performed at long echo times, at which signal generally remains from only three main metabolites: -acetyl aspartate (NAA), which is thought to be a marker of neuronal numbers and function; the sum of creatine and phospho-creatine (Cr), which are central to energy homeostasis; and choline-containing compounds (Cho), which probably are largely related to membrane function.",1
7,"-acetyl aspartyl glutamate (NAAG) – a putative neurotransmitter – may be detected, in white matter in particular, although it is difficult to resolve from NAA.",1
8,"If present at sufficient concentration in the brain (usually only in pathological states), then lactate (Lac) is also visible at long echo times.",1
9,"At short echo times, signal is detectable from several additional metabolites of interest: myo-inositol (Ins), a possible marker of glial cell number and function; glutamate (Glu), a key amino acid neurotransmitter; and glutamine (Gln), a closely related amino acid also linked to neurotransmitter metabolism.",1
10,"Elevations in the combined signal of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) have been shown in some patients with epilepsy, and may be an indication of increased cortical excitability.",1
11,This is potentially of interest not only in understanding the pathophysiology of epilepsy but also in suggesting suitable drug therapies and in monitoring patient progress.,1
12,"However, the signals of glutamate and glutamine overlap to a large extent both with each other and with macromolecules such as proteins, making their reliable estimation very difficult.",2
13,"At 1.5 T, complete spectral resolution of glutamate and glutamine signals is impossible, so spectral modelling is needed.",1
14,"LCModel is a commercially available fitting package, which estimates the concentration of chemicals in the brain with reference to their individual spectra acquired using highly concentrated solutions.",3
15,"This provides estimates of the separate concentrations  of Glu and Gln, and of their combined signal Glx, along with estimates of the uncertainty in these concentrations, based on Cramer–Rao lower bounds.",3
16,"The reliability of measurement of Glx is typically better than that of its individual components, and glutamine in particular would be considered generally to be unreliably determined .",3
17,"The macromolecular baseline signal, which has broad peaks appearing at roughly 0.9, 1.3, 2.4, and 3.2 ppm, is a major limitation of the  application of short echo time proton spectroscopy.",2
18,"These resonances can comprise 30% of the total signal, and spectral modelling is generally unable to find a unique solution to discriminating between these broad signals and the superimposed sharper peaks from small metabolites.",2
19,One method to discriminate signals from macromolecules and neurochemicals is through their different spin-lattice () relaxation times.,3
20,"Macromolecules are relatively immobile, and therefore their protons have much shorter  (approximately 200 ms at 1.5 T ) than those of small metabolites (between 1 and 1.5 s at 1.5 T ).",1
21,"Therefore, spectroscopic acquisition can be preceded by an inversion pulse with a delay chosen to null the signal from one while maintaining signal from the other.",3
22,"It is possible to suppress the lipids and macromolecules directly, using an inversion pulse with a short delay.",3
23,"However, this also reduces signal from small metabolites, and may reduce them differently depending on their differing .",3
24,"It may be possible to optimize lipid suppression somewhat, for example by using a train of inversion pulses, but there is always an accompanying reduction in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the small metabolites.",7
25,"Another problem is that it can be difficult to integrate lipid/macromolecule suppression with water suppression: to attain shorter inversion times, it may be necessary to reduce the number or pulse width of water suppression pulses, leading to less thorough suppression or to poorer frequency specificity, respectively.",3
26,A better approach is to null the signal from small metabolites while maintaining signal from macromolecules.,3
27,The fraction of signal remaining (/) at each inversion time (TI) is calculated from the estimated  of each species and the repetition time (TR) as: / = 1 – 2 exp(–TI/) + exp(–TR/)The resulting macromolecule-weighted spectrum can be subtracted from the original trace to leave a spectrum with only signal from small neurochemicals remaining.,3
28,"Although this method of metabolite nulling has been demonstrated to be capable of separating out the macromolecule signal, it is not widely used , due to the doubled scan time, and the reduction in signal-to-noise ratio inherent in performing a subtraction.",3
29,"However, when estimating cerebral concentrations of especially glutamate and glutamine, signal-to-noise is not as limiting as macromolecule signal overlap, so the benefits of this approach may outweigh the drawbacks.",3
30,"We investigated whether metabolite-nulling improved the reliability of metabolite concentration estimation using the LCModel program, as measured by both the reported uncertainty of estimation and by the spread of concentration estimates in a control group.",9
31,"The study was performed on a 1.5 T General Electric Signa Horizon Echospeed scanner (Milwaukee WI, USA) using the standard birdcage head coil.",3
32,"Axial -weighted inversion–recovery prepared fast spoiled gradient echo images were obtained, both to guide voxel prescription and subsequently for segmentation using SPM99 (Statistical Parametric Mapping; Wellcome Dept.",3
33,"Of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, London) to determine the fractional content of grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the spectroscopic voxels.",3
34,"The concentrations of all metabolites were divided by the estimated fractional brain tissue content of the voxels, to correct for the presence of CSF, as previously described.",10
35,Voxels approximately 4.0 × 3.5 × 2.5 cm in size (Fig. 1) were studied in both frontal lobes of 10 normal volunteers.,10
36,This study was approved by the Joint Research Ethics Committee of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and the Institute of Neurology and all subjects gave informed consent.,1
37,"Point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) localization was used to select the spectroscopy volume, with an echo time of 30 ms and a repetition time of 3 s.",10
38,"Water signal was suppressed using 3 chemical-shift selective (CHESS) pulses in both cases, with the flip angle of the final pulse tailored to ensure slight under-suppression.",10
39,"32 transients each were collected, with and without the inversion, plus 16 transients without CHESS, for a total scan time of approximately 5 min per lobe.",10
40,"The optimum inversion pulse delay was calculated from eqn. (1) to be about 750 ms, assuming a range of  between 1.0 and 1.5 s and a TR of 3 s.",10
41,This was checked in a pilot  study.,1
42,"A 40 cm volume of interest was placed along the midline in one subject, at a level similar to Fig. 1, including equal amounts of tissue from the right and left frontal lobes in case there was a difference in the relaxation times between them.",10
43,"Spectra with inversion times of 550, 650, 750, 850, and 950 ms were acquired and compared to a spectrum with no inversion.",10
44,The inversion time giving the minimum residual metabolite signal was used for all subsequent acquisitions.,10
45,"Spectra were analyzed using LCModel, with and without subtraction of the metabolite-nulled spectrum.",3
46,"The same reference set of spectra from metabolite solutions was used for both analyses, as well as the same calibration factor.",3
47,"Comparisons were made between left and right frontal lobes, and between raw and subtracted data, using paired -tests in SPSS 9.0.",3
48,The average of the standard deviations (SD) reported by LCModel (a reflection of the Cramer–Rao bounds) on the left and right were also compared between raw and subtracted data.,3
49,"An inversion pulse delay of 650 ms was chosen to null the signal from small metabolites, based on the pilot series of acquisitions (Fig. 2).",10
50,"Of the inversion times shown, 750 ms was too long, since positive peaks were clearly visible from NAA, Cr and Cho, whereas 550 ms was too short, since negative peaks appeared for NAA and Cr.",8
51,"A good compromise appeared to be 650 ms, which showed a fairly smooth baseline of broad components.",8
52,"Some residual positive peak of NAA appeared to remain, but this was not seen in all subjects.",8
53,This optimum inversion time was somewhat shorter than predicted by theory; eqn. (1) would suggest 750 ms to be better for the range of  expected.,5
54,This discrepancy may perhaps be due to inversion pulse imperfections; or the metabolites of interest may have somewhat shorter  relaxation times than previously reported.,4
55,"In particular, the protons of small metabolites not forming the large singlet peaks may have  shorter than 1 s.",4
56,"The metabolite-nulled spectra consisted of broad signals similar to those previously observed and assigned to macromolecules , and the average metabolite-nulled spectra from 10 control subjects was found to differ significantly on the left and right (Fig. 3).",8
57,Narrow peaks from the small metabolites were effectively nulled on both sides: the main difference between left and right appeared to be an increase in the broad signal around 1.5 ppm on the subject's left compared to the right.,5
58,In all cases a smoother baseline was fitted when macromolecules were subtracted (Fig. 4).,8
59,"In Fig. 4A, a typical constrained C-spline fit to the baseline is shown.",5
60,"This is similar to the observed macromolecule signal, but clearly had uncertainty associated with it.",5
61,"In the subtracted spectrum, the baseline only included residual water, which can be modelled relatively easily, giving a more consistent result.",5
62,"The SNR was reduced by the subtraction by the expected factor of √2, from a mean of 36 to 26, but remained sufficient for quantification.",3
63,"The reported standard deviations given by LCModel, a reflection of the Cramer–Rao lower bounds, were reduced significantly by baseline subtraction for almost all metabolites, suggesting that quantification had been improved (Table 1).",8
64,"The improvement was most marked for glutamate and glutamine: for Gln, the SD reported by LCModel changed from 31%, which would be considered unreliable, to a more acceptable 19%.",5
65,"For Glx the SD was nearly halved, going from 12% to just over 6%.",5
66,"The spread of measurements in the control group, however, was not much affected by the subtraction of metabolite-nulled data.",8
67,"Some concentrations were increased (Gln, Cr, Lac) and some were reduced (NAAG, Glu, Ins), but the standard deviations of the measurements for each metabolite across the subject group remained fairly stable, as well as the summed concentration of all metabolites measured.",5
68,"This suggests that although LCModel's C-spline estimate of baseline is not perfect, it tends to behave consistently in the presence of macromolecule.",4
69,"The only systematic difference between the left and right was in Glx, and this disappeared when the metabolite-nulled baseline was subtracted.",8
70,"Glx showed a reduction in the SD of the control group as well as in the LCModel SD estimate, confirming that the quantification reliability was improved.",5
71,"Lactate results in controls were still unreliable as estimated by LCModel; however, use of metabolite nulling did increase conspicuousness of Lac (Fig.3) and may therefore allow better determination where it is pathologically elevated.",5
72,"“Metabolite-nulled” spectra were acquired and analyzed, to investigate the macromolecular signal in magnetic resonance spectra at short echo times and its effect upon quantification of the small molecular weight metabolites of interest.",9
73,"Metabolite spectra were analyzed using LCModel with and without the subtraction of the macromolecule baseline, and the concentrations and reliability estimates were compared.",3
74,Similar approaches attempting to improve LCModel fitting of metabolites have been adopted recently by other groups.,1
75,"These merit particular discussion, so the methods they employed will first be described.",1
76,"All have attempted to incorporate macromolecule signals into the LCModel basis set, which has the major advantage that the lengthy acquisition of baseline data may not be necessary in every subject studied.",3
77,The first approach was the incorporation into the basis set merely of simulated lipid peaks at 0.9 and 1.3 ppm.,3
78,"This was shown to aid the discrimination of lipid from baseline, and to improve estimates of lactate and alanine .",3
79,"This may be a particularly advantageous approach in tumours, because lipid, lactate and alanine are often elevated, and these elevations can be significant for differential diagnosis.",3
80,"In addition, tumour lipid peaks are more mobile than those in normal brain and scalp, giving them a longer , so they are not as easily distinguished from small metabolites using -based techniques.",1
81,"However, this technique does not much aid the measurement of glutamate, glutamine, and the other small metabolites overlapped by the other macromolecule regions, either in controls or in conditions such as multiple sclerosis where there may be pathological increases in macromolecule signal throughout the spectrum.",3
82,"No metabolite results in normal controls were shown using this method, so no direct comparison with the current study is possible.",1
83,The second approach was to include the average experimentally determined macromolecule baseline as a single element in the LCModel basis set.,3
84,"This has the advantage that the broad macromolecule signals which overlap with small metabolites are somewhat constrained by those that do not, but the disadvantage that the small (but not completely negligible) inter-subject variation in macromolecule signal cannot be accommodated.",3
85,"LCModel requires the relative peaks of a metabolite (or in this case pseudo-metabolite) to be fixed absolutely, allowing no method to compensate for this variation.",3
86,"However, Hofmann  achieved quite good reproducibility of macromolecule signal among their control subjects by using the more time-consuming but more thorough saturation recovery method to characterize them, which should have minimized this drawback.",3
87,Another methodological difference with the current study is that the echo time was 20 ms instead of 30 ms.,1
88,"This gave higher, and presumably more accurate, metabolite concentration estimates , since the spin–spin () relaxation times  are shorter than in the phantom solutions of the basis set, giving more  weighting in the current study.",3
89,"However, different radiofrequency pulses and gradients are needed for such short echo times, which gives less sharp voxel profiles and greater chemical shift displacement error.",1
90,"This may have increased contamination with lipid and macromolecule signal from outside the voxel, or indeed outside the brain.",3
91,The third approach was to include a series of independently varying parameterized peaks in LCModel to account for the macromolecules and lipids.,3
92,This is better able to accommodate inhomogeneous pathological variation in these signals.,3
93,"However, when they are allowed to vary independently, there is no way to completely constrain the macromolecule resonances which underlie the small metabolite signals at about 2 and 3 ppm.",3
94,"The acquisition methods for that study also differed from the current study: the pulse sequence used for localization was stimulated echo (STEAM) instead of PRESS, the echo time was 15 ms, and the TR was 1.5 s.",1
95,"This gave lower concentration estimates than in the current study, probably because of  weighting of the spectra.",1
96,The shorter echo time also may have led to increased macromolecule signal due to decreased  weighting.,3
97,"Short echo times are more easily combined with sharp voxel definition in STEAM than PRESS, so less of the macromolecule signal should have arisen from outside the voxel; and in addition, stronger outer-volume suppression pulses were used.",1
98,"However, a trade-off remains between strong suppression of the outer volume and oversuppression of the inner volume, which depends on the size and position of the voxel and of the suppression bands.",1
99,Mader . calculated a suppression factor within the voxel ranging from 3% for a white matter voxel to 19% for the pons when the extra-strong outer-volume suppression was used.,6
100,"Macromolecule subtraction has been shown to improve somewhat the reliability of quantification of small metabolites in large frontal lobe voxels , in particular glutamate and glutamine.",8
101,"The reduction in the estimated uncertainty for most metabolites, despite reduced SNR, confirms that the baseline is a major source of error in the fitting of  signal.",4
102,"However, the absence of large changes in the estimated concentrations of most metabolites, even glutamate + glutamine, confirms that the C-spline baseline used by LCModel performs surprisingly well.",4
103,"With the method employed here, the summed metabolite signal stayed constant: the sum of metabolites on the left and right in Table 1 is 47.9 mM for the raw spectra, and 47.7 mM following baseline subtraction.",5
104,Hofmann . found a global reduction in the estimated concentrations of nearly all the major small metabolites by about 10% on average when macromolecule signal was included in the basis set.,1
105,"Of the metabolites in Table 1, only Cho in the white matter was not reduced significantly in that study by the incorporation of macromolecule into the basis set.",1
106,"Seeger . had a less significant reduction in metabolites when macromolecule was incorporated, about 5% on average, with only NAA + NAAG and Cho reaching significance (and with Cr, as in the current study, being significantly elevated).",1
107,"It seems that when LCModel is provided with very broad signals in the basis set, there may be a tendency to overfit them to the data.",4
108,This is a major potential drawback for methods incorporating macromolecule signal into LCModel.,4
109,"Hofmann , Seeger , and the current study all showed a significant reduction in NAA + NAAG when methods were incorporated to account for macromolecule.",5
110,"This may seem surprising, since quantification of NAA and NAAG is based mainly on the most prominent peak in the spectrum, which should be relatively unaffected by the baseline.",8
111,"Looking at the NAA and NAAG separately, Hofmann . concur that the dominant effect is on NAAG, which was reduced by 21% in white matter and 45% in grey matter.",1
112,This suggests that in the raw  spectra LCModel fitted some macromolecule signal as NAAG.,1
113,"The other metabolites with prominent peaks were also affected by macromolecule correction methods, although to a lesser extent.",1
114,Myo-inositol showed a trend of reduction by about 5% in all 3 studies.,8
115,"Cho was reduced by about 5% in the current study (non-significantly) and by a similar amount in Seeger In Hofmann , it was unchanged in white matter and increased by about 15% percent in grey matter.",8
116,"Cr was increased by about 5% by macromolecule correction in the current study and in Seeger , and decreased by about 5% in white matter in Hofmann  Probably these small differences indicate that the C-spline baseline fitted by LCModel does not precisely match the macromolecule signal, although the approximation is close.",8
117,"Therefore, macromolecule corrections may improve the accuracy of measuring these “conventional” metabolites at short echo times also.",4
118,The increased conspicuousness of Lac following subtraction of the macromolecule baseline may allow better determination where it is pathologically elevated.,4
119,One caveat is that if Lac had an especially long  it would be overestimated due to subtraction of negative signal at an inversion time of 650 ms.,4
120,Hofmann . and Seeger . found that incorporating macromolecule signal into LCModel reduced the estimated Lac instead of increasing it as in the current study: it is unclear which method may be more accurate.,4
121,"However, even if it were less accurate, metabolite-nulling may be preferred as being more precise: it was found to be invaluable in distinguishing between pathologically elevated lipids and abnormally high lactate in multiple sclerosis lesions.",3
122,"Although we found no significant effect of macromolecule subtraction on the estimated Glx (glutamate plus glutamine), there was redistribution between these overlapping peaks, with a reduction in the estimated glutamate and an increase in glutamine.",8
123,The elimination of broad resonances underlying the peaks would be expected to have aided in this discrimination; but the lack of a definitive gold standard makes it impossible to judge which is more accurate.,4
124,"Hofmann . showed large reductions in both glutamate and glutamine, again suggesting possible overfitting of macromolecule.",1
125,"Seeger . didn't report glutamate and glutamine separately, but found no significant change in Glx.",1
126,It is unclear why Glx was not affected by the incorporation of a broad unconstrained macromolecule peak at the same frequency in the basis set.,1
127,"From the same group, Mader . found that Glx interfered with macromolecule estimation at 2.1 ppm, so it seems likely that macromolecule would interfere with Glx estimation.",1
128,This inability to discriminate between macromolecule and Glx argues that the acquisition of metabolite-nulled data may be necessary to reliably determine Glx.,4
129,In the past we have demonstrated elevations in Glx in temporal lobe epilepsy and idiopathic generalized epilepsy.,1
130,"In future, we will apply these methods of metabolite-nulling both to ensure that this elevation is not due to artifactual macromolecule signal, and also to attempt to estimate the individual concentrations of glutamate and glutamine.",1
131,Previous studies have shown elevations in glutamine alone in epilepsy patients taking vigabatrin or valproate.,1
132,"We showed a marked left–right difference in the macromolecule signal recorded, with greater signal around 1.5 ppm on the subject's left.",8
133,"A very similar difference has been shown between spectra from predominantly grey and predominantly white matter , with the greater signal around 1.5 ppm in grey matter voxels being ascribed to the tissue content difference.",1
134,"In the current study, the estimated percentage content of grey matter was similar on the two sides (30 ± 3% on the left; 29 ± 5% on the right), so tissue content can be excluded as the source of this.",5
135,The difference was more likely to be due to differences in the amount and phase of macromolecule signal contamination from outside the gradient-selected region of interest.,4
136,This can cause a consistent directional difference because the gradient used to select the volume of interest always varied from negative on the left to positive on the right.,4
137,"A similar effect may possibly have been acting in the Hofmann study: more signal at 1.5 ppm was seen in the grey matter voxel, which was positioned in the occipital lobe at the posterior of the brain, than in the white matter voxel, which was located anteriorly in the centrum semiovale.",4
138,"On GE 5X Signa scanners, posterior is conventionally the negative gradient direction, although whether this was so in Hofmann  is not known.",1
139,"In both the current study and in Hofmann's work, standard outer-volume suppression pulses available on a GE 5X Signa scanner were used.",3
140,"With the use of stronger outer volume saturation, more macromolecule signal at 1.5 ppm was also found in grey matter than in white.",8
141,"However, caution is needed in interpreting subtle changes in macromolecule as true physiological differences, because in the neocortex, grey matter voxels are by definition almost always further towards the periphery of the brain: closer to the scalp and further from the magnet isocentre.",4
142,A better method to investigate grey/white matter differences in macromolecule content may be magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging.,1
143,"Contamination with extra-cerebral signal remains a problem, but the spatial encoding helps identify the origin and extent of the contaminating signal; and the acquisition of data from multiple voxels containing variable tissue content may enable the more effective modelling of macromolecule content in grey and white matter.",8
144,"Hwang . collected macromolecule-weighted MRSI, and although they did not investigate the tissue content dependence of macromolecule signal per se, they commented upon finding a uniform distribution of macromolecule signal intensity within the excited region of interest, implying that no such tissue content dependence existed.",1
145,"In one of our own MRSI studies at an echo time of 30 ms, we showed spectra obtained from voxels containing mostly grey matter and mostly white matter.",1
146,"Neither showed appreciable macromolecule signal at 1.5 ppm, although signal at this frequency was excited in the scalp well outside the PRESS-selected region of interest.",1
147,"When lesions are investigated, they are likely to be distributed heterogeneously in different patients, so the macromolecule signal is likely to suffer even more from variable inclusion of extra-voxel contamination in patients than in controls.",1
148,"In an elegant demonstration that lipids detected in a multiple sclerosis lesion were not caused by scalp contamination, Davie . studied a control voxel located in normal-appearing tissue between the lesion voxel and the scalp, and verified that the lipid/macromolecule signal was not elevated at that location compared to controls.",1
149,"This sort of validation is vital to enable sound interpretation of macromolecular signal ; we have chosen instead to regard macromolecular signal as largely artifactual, and to attempt to minimize its effect on metabolite analysis.",2
150,"In summary, there are several methods available to investigate the distinct contributions of macromolecules and small metabolites to  proton spectra.",1
151,"Which of these is the best solution to the problem depends on which metabolites are of most interest, and on the specific pathology.",4
152,"Methods have been proposed for modelling macromolecule signal without the separate acquisition of metabolite-nulled data; but none has yet demonstrated convincing improvement in the quantification of glutamate and glutamine, which are metabolites of central interest in seizure disorders.",3
153,"Acquisition of a separate metabolite-nulled dataset is time-consuming, but not prohibitively so if fairly large volumes of interest are used, as in characterizing normal tissues.",3
154,It is likely to be less useful in studying small focal lesions than in studying larger lesions or more widespread abnormalities.,3
0,On the role of the CP47 core antenna in the energy transfer and trapping dynamics of Photosystem II,9
1,The CP47–RC complex of photosystem II (PS II) has an antenna subunit of 16 chlorophyll  molecules attached to the reaction center (RC) at the side of its inactive branch.,1
2,"The X-ray structure of PS II revealed that the shortest interpigment distances between CP47 and RC are about 21 Å, which is two-three times larger than within each subunit.",8
3,Such long distances may slow down the energy transfer from CP47 to RC.,7
4,In order to evaluate the influence of the CP47 antenna on the energy transfer and trapping dynamics in the RC we performed a comparative analysis of CP47–RC and RC complexes from spinach by transient difference absorption and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy at room temperature.,9
5,Our data reveal a complex multiexponential decay of the excited states in both complexes.,5
6,"The main trapping lifetimes are 2–3, 30–40 and 360–460 ps in the RC and 2–6, 80–85 and 650–700 ps in the CP47–RC, the latter two phases being two to three times longer than in the RC.",5
7,"The data could be fitted well with a kinetic model consisting of three reversible radical pair states, the first one being nearly isoenergetic with P680*, and identical energy levels and kinetics of processes occurring within the RC in both complexes.",5
8,We conclude that there is no kinetic limitation of the energy transfer between CP47 and RC on the two slowest trapping phases and that this transfer occurs in 20 ps or less.,4
9,The two factors that influence the observed slower trapping in CP47–RC are the highly reversible charge separation reaction in the RC and the presence in CP47 of states with energy lower than the primary electron donor P680.,4
10,"In the thylakoid membranes of green plants, algae and cyanobacteria the reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PS II) is surrounded by a number of pigment-protein complexes that harvest sunlight and efficiently deliver excitation energy to the RC.",1
11,"The subunits most close to the RC are CP43 and CP47, which together with the RC and a number of extrinsic proteins involved in water oxidation constitute the PS II core complex.",1
12,Structures of cyanobacterial PS II core complexes were obtained recently at 3.5–3.8 Å resolution.,1
13,"The main features of the cyanobacterial structure match reasonably well those of green plants, so it is valid to use the X-ray structure of PS II from cyanobacteria as a model for the structure of the PS II core complex of higher plants.",1
14,"According to the X-ray structure the RC (D1/D2/Cyt ) complex comprises 8 chlorins and 2 carotenes, all of which participate in the energy transfer and/or electron transfer processes.",1
15,Four chlorophyll (Chl) and two pheophytin (Pheo) molecules are arranged in two branches in the central part of the complex.,1
16,One branch is known to be active in charge separation.,1
17,"Two Chl molecules are bound at the periphery of the complex at distances of about 24 Å from the core pigments and do not participate in the primary charge separation process, though they can be involved in secondary electron transfer processes, just as the two β-carotene molecules and cytochrome .",1
18,The CP47 complex contains 16 Chls and two β-carotenes.,1
19,In the thylakoid membrane it is located at the side of the inactive branch of the RC.,1
20,"The closest interpigment distance between CP47 (Chl43 according to the nomenclature in ) and RC (Pheo and ChlZ) is about 21 Å, which is considerably more than the  9 Å average interpigment distance in CP47.",1
21,"In all PS II RC preparations obtained thusfar the secondary electron acceptors, the plastoquinones Q and Q, were removed from their binding sites during the isolation procedure, implying that photochemistry does not proceed beyond the primary radical pair.",1
22,"The CP47–RC complex differs from the RC mainly by the presence of the additional antenna subunit, because Q is also largely absent after isolation and purification.",1
23,This means that these two complexes represent a good target for comparative studies of the influence the CP47 core antenna on the energy transfer and charge separation processes in the RC.,1
24,The kinetics of energy transfer and trapping in the RC have been studied by several groups using both ultrafast absorbance difference and fluorescence techniques.,3
25,The results were reviewed elsewhere.,1
26,"According to these studies the transfer of excitation energy within the six central chlorins of the RC is ultrafast, with a time constant of about 100 or 600 fs upon excitation into the blue or red edge of the Q absorption band, respectively, though slower energy transfer components can probably not be excluded, in particular at low temperatures.",1
27,"It was suggested that charge separation occurs from an excited state which at least at room temperature is distributed over a significant fraction of the six core chlorins, depending on the particular realisation of the disorder.",1
28,"The charge separation reactions are strongly multiphasic, with main components in the range of 0.4–3, 20–50 and 120–500 ps.",1
29,"The details of charge separation process are not precisely understood yet, especially with regard to the role of the “accessory” Chl on the active branch of the RC (Chl according to the nomenclature in ).",2
30,"It has been proposed that at least at low temperatures Chl acts as primary electron donor and that the Chl Pheo pair occurs first, followed by electron transfer from P to Chl.",1
31,The findings that Chl is the red-most absorbing chromophore in the PS II RC and that Pheo and Chl give rise to a charge-transfer state of about equal energy with those of the main exciton states are in line with this idea.,1
32,"Lifetimes of about 0.4, 3 and 8 ps were suggested for the primary charge separation.",1
33,The 20–50 ps processes were interpreted as formation of a secondary radical pair or primary charge separation limited by the slow transfer from the peripheral Chls to the core of RC.,1
34,"The 200–500 ps kinetics, initially attributed to radical pair relaxation due to electron transfer to Q, were also observed in isolated RC preparations, which do not contain Q.",1
35,"It was proposed that the slow relaxation reactions of the radical pair may be induced by conformational changes of the protein, induced by the creation of the two charges.",1
36,Recent experiments indicated that most of the energy transfer dynamics in CP47 occurs within 2–3 ps.,1
37,In CP47 the lowest energetic state absorbs at 690 nm with an oscillator strength equal to that of 1 Chl.,1
38,The 690 nm state gives a major contribution to the low temperature emission of CP47 and determines a 17 ps lifetime of energy transfer in CP47 at 77 K. The 690 nm pigment is most probably located at the periphery of CP47 not close to the RC and its population will slow down rather than speed up the energy transfer to the reaction center.,1
39,"For PS II core complexes it was initially proposed that excitation energy equilibrates rapidly within several hundreds of femtoseconds between the core antenna and the RC, and that then charge separation occurs within several picoseconds (trap-limited model).",2
40,Earlier fluorescence measurements performed on CP47–RC and larger PS II particles supported the fast energy equilibration between core antenna and RC.,3
41,"In contrast, calculations of energy transfer rates performed on the basis of the recently published PS II structures suggested slow energy transfer from the core antenna to RC, even though most of the Chls in the core antenna are oriented in a way favourable for efficient transfer to the RC.",2
42,The lifetime of charge separation depends in this case on the slow energy delivery process from the core antenna to the RC (transfer-to-the-trap-limited model).,1
43,In this contribution we present room temperature transient absorption and time-resolved fluorescence studies on PS II RC and CP47–RC complexes purified from spinach.,9
44,Our goal was to record the energy transfer and trapping processes in RC and CP47–RC under similar experimental conditions to be able to make a reliable comparison of the obtained results.,0
45,The results indicate that the presence of the CP47 antenna reduces the rate constants of trapping by a factor of 2–3.,5
46,"A fit based on a kinetic model suggests that the slower trapping observed in CP47–RC is caused by a shift of the excited states distribution towards the CP47 antenna, and that the intrinsic rate for energy transfer from CP47 to RC does not limit the overall trapping kinetics in the CP47–RC complex.",5
47,PSII RCs were purified from spinach Tris-washed “BBY” grana membranes as described by van Leeuwen,3
48,CP47–RC complexes were purified from spinach as described elsewhere.,3
49,"For the spectroscopic measurements, all samples were diluted in a buffer containing 20 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 10 mM MgCl, 10 mM CaCl and 0.03% -dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (β-DM).",10
50,"Semi-anaerobic conditions in the samples were created by addition of catalase, glucose and glucose oxidase, in that order, to final concentrations of 120 μg ml, 10 mM and 120 μg ml, respectively.",10
51,"The optical density (OD) of the samples used for the transient absorption and fluorescence measurements was about 0.7 mm and 0.8 cm, respectively, at the Q absorption maximum.",10
52,The steady state absorption of the samples was compared before and after measurement.,3
53,Sample degradation was in all cases less than 1%.,8
54,We also analyzed the CP47–RC complex before and after measurement by diode-array-assisted gel filtration chromatography.,3
55,This technique allows a quantitative estimation of the amount of free CP47 and free pigments in the samples.,3
56,"The results revealed a contamination of free CP47 complexes of 1% or less in the samples and no measurable amount of free chlorophylls (not shown), suggesting no significant contribution of unbound CP47 or free chlorophylls to the observed kinetics.",5
57,"Absorption difference spectra were recorded with a femtosecond spectrophotometer, described in detail elsewhere.",3
58,"In brief, the output of Ti:Sapphire oscillator (Coherent Mira) was amplified by means of chirped pulse amplification (Alpha-1000 US, B. M. Industries), generating 1 kHz, 800 nm, 60 fs pulses.",10
59,Single-filament probe white light was generated in a 2 mm sapphire plate.,10
60,Pump light at 400 nm was obtained by doubling the 800 nm fundamental  a SHG crystal.,10
61,"Pump light in the visible wavelength range was produced in a home-built, noncollinear optical parametric amplifier.",10
62,"After prism compression, the pulse duration was reduced to 50–60 fs.",10
63,"Interference filters with transmission maxima at 662 and 695 nm and fwhm 12 and 15 nm, respectively, were used to select the wavelength of excitation.",10
64,Transient absorption difference spectra were collected with probe and excitation beams oriented at magic angle.,10
65,The excitation beam was focused in a spot with 350 μm diameter.,10
66,"The energy of excitation was 15 nJ pulse upon 662 and 695 nm excitations, and 30 nJ pulse upon 400 nm excitation.",10
67,"We estimated that about 0.25–0.5 photons were absorbed by each complex per laser shot upon 400 nm excitation, and 0.1–0.2 photons per complex upon 662 and 695 nm excitations.",5
68,The cuvette (1 mm pathlength) was shaken in order to refresh the sample from shot to shot.,10
69,The time resolution was typically 120 fs and the spectral resolution was 3 nm.,10
70,"The data were corrected for white light group velocity dispersion and instrument response, and fitted globally as described in .",3
71,A coherent coupling between pump and probe pulses was included into the fit function for the data obtained upon 662 and 695 nm excitations.,3
72,Time-resolved fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a Hamamatsu C5680 synchroscan streak camera as described in .,3
73,"In short, the output of a Ti:Sapphire oscillator (Coherent Mira-Rega), generating 125 kHz, 800 nm, 150 fs pulses, was doubled  an OPA (Coherent), producing 125 kHz, 400 nm, 150 fs pulses.",10
74,A 665 nm light was generated  the OPA (Coherent) and selected with the interference filter with fwhm = 5 nm.,10
75,The sample was placed in a spinning cell (diameter 10 cm) with rotation frequency of 75 Hz.,10
76,"The excitation energy was 1–2 nJ/pulse and the excitation beam was focused in a spot with 150 μm diameter, corresponding to about 0.05–0.1 absorbed photons per complex.",10
77,Fluorescence was collected at magic angle with respect to the polarization of the excitation beam.,3
78,"The time resolution was 3.5 ps for 400 nm excitation and 6 ps for 665 nm excitation, the spectral resolution was 5 nm.",10
79,"The fluorescence data were corrected for white light group velocity dispersion and instrument response, and fitted globally as described in .",3
80,Fig. 1 shows room temperature absorption spectra of the isolated RC and CP47–RC complexes.,8
81,The Q absorption band peaks at 675 and 675.5 nm for the RC and CP47–RC respectively.,8
82,"The Q absorption band of the RC is highly congested, though there is some evidence that the peripheral Chls contribute more to the blue side of the Q absorption (670–675 nm), and that most of the six central chlorins of the PS II RC absorb at around 680 nm.",5
83,"Thus, some selectivity can be achieved upon applying different wavelengths of excitations.",3
84,The Q band of isolated CP47 overlaps fully with that of the PS II RC and is even broader than this spectrum due to the presence in CP47 of Chls absorbing at energies higher and lower than those of the RC.,5
85,Thus selective excitation of one of subunits within CP47–RC can not be achieved.,4
86,"The different lineshapes of the two preparations in the Soret region is explained by the relatively higher content in the RC of Pheo  and cytochrome -559, which both have strong absorbances at 416 nm.",5
87,"Transient difference absorption spectra of RC and CP47–RC were measured on a time scale up to 4 ns upon excitation into the Soret band of Chl  ( = 400 nm), and the blue and red edges of the Q absorption band ( = 662 and 695 nm, respectively).",10
88,The decay-associated difference spectra (DADS) obtained after global analysis are shown in Fig. 2.,8
89,The decay of delta absorption in the PS II RC complex could be fitted reasonably well with five components for 662 and 400 nm excitation and three components for 695 nm excitation.,5
90,The first DADS has a lifetime of about 100 fs and has a very different shape for the three wavelengths of excitation.,8
91,"Upon 400 nm excitation it has a strongly positive amplitude (Fig. 2e), indicating that excited states of Q absorption bands are populated during this time.",5
92,This phase can therefore be attributed to Soret to Q relaxation processes.,5
93,The first DADS upon 662 nm excitation (Fig. 2c) has a negative peak at 670 nm and a positive peak at 683 nm.,8
94,The conservative shape suggests energy transfer from species absorbing maximally at 670 nm to species absorbing maximally at 683 nm.,5
95,Subpicosecond equilibration processes in PS II RC complexes were observed and extensively discussed before.,8
96,"This fast equilibration must almost exclusively occur within the six central chlorines of the PS II RC, because there is evidence that the peripheral Chls transfer energy to the central pigments on a much slower timescale (10–30 ps).",5
97,"The second DADS has a lifetime of about 2–3 ps and has similar, but not identical shapes upon different wavelengths of excitation.",8
98,For 400 and 695 nm excitation it consists of a negative band peaking at about 683 nm and a positive band around 660–670 nm.,8
99,"For 662 nm excitation, the negative band is slightly blue-shifted while no positive band between 660 and 670 is observed.",8
100,We attribute this phase to primary charge separation.,4
101,"Merry . reported a 600 fs uphill energy transfer in PS II RC complexes upon 694 nm excitation, which was better resolved in data with a parallel orientation of pump and probe beams.",1
102,"It is possible that uphill energy transfer contributes to the 2 ps DADS in our magic angle data upon 695 nm excitation, but that it could not be resolved as a separate, 600 fs component.",7
103,The shape of the 2 ps DADS obtained upon 400 and 695 nm is similar to the 3 ± 1 ps DADS obtained upon 543 nm excitation into the Q band of Pheo  (data not shown).,8
104,This gives evidence that Pheo contributes to the absorption around 680 nm and also confirms that Pheo participates in the initial charge separation process.,4
105,"The third DADS has a lifetime of about 20–30 ps and has a negative amplitude in the whole Q range, except for a positive feature around 680 nm upon 662 and 400 nm excitation.",8
106,The negative contribution in the red edge of this DADS for a large part is due to the decay of stimulated emission.,5
107,"Stimulated emission must occur from excited states, implying that excited states still contribute to the observed absorption changes on the tens of ps timescale, in line with the fluorescence measurements (see below).",4
108,"The positive feature around 680 nm may occur as a result of several processes: energy transfer from peripheral chlorophylls peaking at 670 nm, electrochromic bandshifts caused by the positive and negative charges associated with P Pheo formation, like in the bacterial RC, and a blueshift of red exciton states caused by P Pheo formation.",5
109,"Excitation at 695 nm will prevent the first possibility, and the absence of the positive 680 nm feature upon 695 nm excitation suggests that energy transfer from peripheral chlorophylls at 670–680 nm states gives an important contribution to the overall kinetics.",5
110,"The fourth DADS has a very small amplitude in transient absorption, and has a lifetime of about 360–460 ps.",8
111,"This phase was not observed upon 695 nm excitation, which could be due to its small amplitude.",5
112,"This phase has a prominent amplitude in the fluorescence decay (see below), and can therefore be attributed to radical pair relaxation.",5
113,"The non-decaying (ND) absorbance within the time range of our experiments has a minimum at 680 nm and is positive at wavelengths longer than 700 nm, which is an indicator of presence of the PPheo radical pair, the final product of charge separation.",5
114,"It is known that in the isolated RC the radical pair has a lifetime of about 50 ns at room temperature, which then recombines to the ground state or the P680* singlet or triplet state.",1
115,Its shape is identical upon all wavelengths of excitation.,8
116,"The global analysis revealed six, five and four components for CP47–RC upon 400, 662 and 695 nm excitation (Fig. 2b, d, f).",8
117,The first DADS (80–180 fs) have similar shapes as those observed in the RC and similar origins: Soret to Q energy transfer for 400 nm excitation and energy equilibration between 670 and 680 nm absorbing species for 662 nm excitation.,5
118,"It is likely that the latter phase occurs not only in the RC, but also within CP47, because in isolated CP47 a strong 200 fs energy transfer from 670 to 680 nm absorbing species was found (at 77 K).",5
119,In all traces one or two transients were found with lifetimes of 2–6 ps.,8
120,"These lifetimes most probably reflect a mixture of at least two processes: downhill energy transfer within CP47, as was shown to occur at 77 K, and charge separation within the RC (like the 2.5 ps component in the RC).",5
121,It is also possible that energy equilibration between CP47 and RC contributes to this phase.,5
122,"The shapes of the 2–4 ps phases are similar to those of the corresponding phases in the RC, which suggests that direct charge separation within the RC contributes to a significant extent to these phases.",5
123,The 6 ps phase upon 400 nm excitation has a shape consistent with downhill energy transfer within CP47.,8
124,"The third series of DADS have lifetimes of 75–90 ps and have roughly similar shapes as those of the 20–30 ps DADS in the RC, exept for the large negative feature caused by CP47 excited states.",8
125,"The negative amplitudes suggest that they all reflect a recovery of bleach, caused by a conversion of chlorophyll/pheophytin excited states into their oxidizes/reduced states.",5
126,"These DADS can therefore be attributed to the secondary trapping process, which in CP47–RC has an about threefold increased lifetime.",5
127,A fourth series of DADS have lifetimes of 750–1000 ps.,8
128,"The amplitudes of these DADS are larger than those in the RC, and the lifetimes are two to three times longer.",8
129,It is likely that a third step of radical pair relaxation contributes to these decays.,5
130,The fact that these DADS are larger than in the RC can be explained by the fact that due to the presence of CP47 about 3x more excited states remain before this phase occurs.,5
131,"For all excitation wavelengths, the non-decaying (ND) components have similar shapes as those observed for the RC, and thus reflect the absorbance difference spectrum of the P Pheo radical pair.",5
132,From the results of this section we conclude that in both complexes multiexponential trapping by charge separation occurs.,4
133,"The lifetimes of trapping are about 2–3, 23–30 and 360–460 ps for the RC and 2–4, 70–90 and 700–1000 ps for CP47–RC.",5
134,The last two processes are about three times longer in CP47–RC than in the RC.,5
135,"Fig. 3 shows the steady-state emission spectra of RC and CP47–RC at room temperature which peak at 681 and 683 nm, respectively.",8
136,Isolated CP47 peaks at 683 nm.,8
137,The 2 nm red shift of the CP47–RC emission maximum is consistent with the fact that CP47 makes a significant contribution to the emission of the CP47–RC complex.,5
138,"We have measured time-resolved fluorescence spectra of RC and CP47–RC upon 400 and 665 nm excitation, using a streak camera set-up.",3
139,"This technique allows a better time and spectral resolution than the more commonly used single-photon timing technique, and was used before for an analysis of RC complexes with red excitation (F. van Mourik ., manuscript in preparation).",3
140,"For our experiments, the time resolution was 3.5 ps for 400 nm excitation and 6 ps for 665 nm excitation.",10
141,This was not sufficient to resolve subpicosecond processes with similar accuracy as in pump–probe experiments.,3
142,Experimental traces are shown in Fig. 4.,8
143,It is obvious from these pictures that CP47–RC is characterised by a longer decay of the emission than RC.,8
144,The decay associated emission spectra (DAES) for RC and CP47–RC are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.,8
145,"Apart from a poorly resolved sub-picosecond transient, four components were needed to fit the fluorescence decay of the RC for 400 and 665 nm excitation (Figs. 5a and 6a, respectively).",1
146,"The first DAES has a lifetime of about 3 ps, and peaks considerably (400 and 695 nm excitation: F. van Mourik ., manuscript in preparation) or slightly (665 nm excitation) more to the red than all subsequent decay phases.",8
147,The DAES for 400 nm excitation has a positive peak at 690 nm and a small negative feature at 672 nm.,8
148,The shape of this DAES is non-conservative (with a large positive and a small negative part).,8
149,The large positive part (decrease of fluorescence) reflects the trapping by charge separation from states emitting around 685–690 nm.,5
150,The small negative part can be explained by uphill energy transfer.,5
151,"The following DAES have positive amplitudes and lifetimes of 39 and 360 ps, and reflect subsequent processes of trapping by charge separation.",5
152,"This subsequent trapping could only be observed in fluorescence measurements when excited states are still present in the complex,  if trapping is intrinsically multi-exponential.",1
153,"One possible cause for multi-exponentiality is that trapping is reversible and that the initially formed radical pair ‘relaxes’, which will causes a decrease of excited states population resulting in a decrease of fluorescence.",1
154,"The 39 ps DAES upon 400 nm excitation and the 400 ps DAES upon both excitation wavelengths are similar in shape compared to the steady-state emission of the RC, suggesting that at least the 400 ps processes occur from excited states equilibrated over all pigments.",5
155,Comparison of the 40 ps DAES upon 400 and 665 nm excitation (Fig. 7) reveals that this DAES upon 665 nm excitation has a larger contribution in the blue part around 670 nm.,8
156,"This suggests that the 40 ps trapping process occurs from a non-equilibrated state and thus can be a mixture of at least two processes: slow energy transfer from (peripheral) chlorophylls absorbing around 670 nm, and trapping by the formation of a secondary radical pair.",5
157,"The 400 ps DAES contributes significantly to the emission of the RC, consistent with radical pair relaxation.",8
158,The last DAES have a lifetime more than 15 ns which can be attributed to the lifetime of radical pair.,8
159,"The DAES obtained for CP47–RC upon 400 and 665 nm excitation are shown in Figs. 5b and 6b, respectively.",8
160,"The first DAES has a lifetime of about 5 ps, but a very different shape for both excitation wavelengths.",8
161,"Upon 665 nm excitation, it has a positive peak at 675 nm and negative peak at 695 nm, consistent with energy transfer within CP47.",8
162,The non-conservative character of this DAES suggests that trapping also occurs on the same time scale.,4
163,"Upon 400 nm excitation, the shape of this component is similar to the 3 ps component in the RC.",8
164,"Its amplitude, however, is smaller than that of the next DAES in the CP47–RC complex.",5
165,This phase must be largely due to charge separation.,4
166,The following two DAES have positive amplitudes and reflect trapping by charge separation with lifetimes of about 80–85 ps and 650–700 ps.,5
167,"These times are similar to those observed in transient absorption, and the amplitudes suggest that both processes contribute about equally to the trapping.",5
168,The large amplitudes of these DAESes suggest that the decay of CP47 excited states largely contributes to these components.,4
169,The last DAES has a lifetime longer than 15 ns which can attributed to the lifetime of radical pair.,5
170,The analysis of the time-resolved fluorescence and transient difference absorption data allowed us to make the following conclusions.,1
171,"In the PS II RC complex, the excitation energy is rapidly (about 100 fs and less than 2–3 ps upon excitation in the blue and red edges of the Q absorption band, respectively) redistributed among the central six pigments of the RC between states absorbing at around 670 and 680 nm.",5
172,Then the initial trapping process occurs with a timeconstant of 2–3 ps.,5
173,The following 30–40 ps process is a mixture of at least two: secondary radical pair formation and transfer of excitation energy from blue-shifted Chls.,5
174,A 360–460 ps trapping phase can be assigned to further radical pair relaxation.,5
175,The relaxed radical pair lives longer than 15 ns.,5
176,"In CP47–RC, the first trapping phase takes place on the 2–6 ps timescale, but its kinetics can not easily be followed because of the presence of a major energy transfer process within CP47 in the same time range.",5
177,Also energy transfer between CP47 and RC can in principle occur on this timescale.,5
178,Just as in the RC there are two subsequent trapping phases.,5
179,Both are about three times longer in CP47–RC than in RC.,5
180,"Thus, the addition of the CP47 antenna results in a lengthening of the two slow phases in excited state decay by a factor of about three.",4
181,"These experimental observations can be explained in at least two ways: (1) the intrinsic rate constant of energy transfer between CP47 and RC is slow due to long distances between the pigments of CP47 and RC; this slow transfer would slow down the subsequent process of trapping in the RC, and (2) the intrinsic rate constant of energy transfer between CP47 and RC is fast, while the excited states distribution is shifted towards CP47 because of red-absorbing states.",4
182,The equilibration of the excited states over a larger antenna will then cause the slower trapping lifetimes observed in the experiments.,4
183,"These two possibilities can be summarized as transfer-to-the-trap-limited and trap-limited kinetics, respectively.",4
184,"For the RC, we used a model with five compartments (Fig. 8a).",6
185,"Compartments ‘A*’ and ‘RC*’ correspond to the average excited state energy levels of blue 670 Chls and bulk 680 chlorins, respectively.",6
186,The former may correspond to the two distant Chls in the RC; the latter to the six central chlorins of the RC core.,6
187,Compartment ‘RP1’ represents the energy level of the first radical pair.,6
188,The subsequent relaxations of the radical pair are represented by the compartments ‘RP2’ and ‘RP3’.,6
189,"For simplicity, we discard fast equilibration within the RC core, and thus assume that charge separation takes place from a state equilibrated over all core pigments.",3
190,We only modelled the fluorescence data upon 665 nm excitation.,3
191,All compartments are connected by forward and backward energy transfer.,6
192,"The back transfer rate was calculated  the Boltzmann factor:  = (/)exp(−/), in which  is the number of chlorophylls in compartment ,  is the energy difference between compartment  and compartment ,  is Boltzmann’s constant,  is the absolute temperature.",6
193,The losses including emission are expressed  the value  which is of the order of the lifetime of fluorescence of free Chl.,6
194,The total emission decay is proportional to the sum of decays of populations of excited states ‘A*’ and ‘RC*’.,6
195,"In order to exclude the influence of apparatus response functions on the experimentally measured kinetics, we used data obtained from global analysis of the fluorescence measurements, and integrated over all wavelengths.",3
196,"The latter simplification is justified, because apart from the 2–3 ps phase all decay components have similar spectra.",3
197,The model presented in Fig. 8a gives a good fit of the fluorescence decay in the PS II RC.,8
198,The fit for the 665 nm excitation data is shown in Fig. 9a.,8
199,The parameters of the fit are listed in Table 1 together with the reciprocal eigenvalues obtained from the solution of the master equation describing the model.,8
200,The reciprocal eigenvalues are close to the time constants obtained in the experiment.,8
201,"Values of 25.7 and 37.4 ps can not be resolved separately, and give a single value of 23–30 ps in pump–probe and 39 ps in fluorescence.",5
202,"The energy gap between ‘A*’ and ‘RC*’ is 284 cm, assuming that blue Chls and bulk chlorins absorb maximally at 670 and 683 nm respectively.",5
203,Slight changes in these energy levels did not significantly influence the fit.,8
204,We assumed that ‘RC*’ and ‘RP1’ are nearly isoenergetic.,6
205,Slightly higher or lower energy levels for ‘RP1’ relatively to ‘RC*’ did not increase the quality of the fit.,8
206,The two subsequent relaxations give an energy differences between ‘RC*’ and the final charge separated state ‘RP3’ of 76.5 meV.,5
207,This value has been measured to lie between 46 and 110 meV.,1
208,The fact that the initial radical pairs are not much below the excited state in free energy explains why the emission can be observed over such a long time window.,4
209,The contribution of each compartment of the model to the total decay of emission is shown in Fig. 10a.,8
210,It is clear from the picture that ‘RC*’ and ‘RP1’ fully equilibrate in about 180 ps.,8
211,After that the populations of the both states remain similar.,8
212,The contribution of the blue chls (compartment ‘A*’) to the total decay is essential only up to about 100 ps.,8
213,For the CP47–RC we added an additional compartment ‘B*’ (Fig. 8b) corresponding to the average energy level of CP47. ‘B*’ is reversibly connected with the compartments ‘A*’ and ‘RC*’.,6
214,"In this case compartment ‘A*’ corresponds to the average energy level of only one distant Chl from RC, the closest to CP47.",6
215,"The total emission decay is proportional to the sum of decays of populations of excited states ‘A*’, ‘B*’ and ‘RC*’.",6
216,The fit of CP47–RC fluorescence upon 665 nm excitation is shown in Fig. 9b.,8
217,"For the processes occurring within the RC, we used the same energy levels and rate constants as found for the isolated RC complex.",3
218,The parameters of the fit and the eigenvalues are listed in Table 2.,8
219,To obtain a good fit of the experimental data it was necessary to set level ‘B*’ lower in energy than ‘RC*’.,3
220,A small energy gap of 42.9 cm (see Table 2) still allows efficient uphill energy transfer from ‘B*’ to ‘RC*’ at room temperature.,5
221,"Furthermore, a good fit of the data can only be obtained if the intrinsic rate constant of energy transfer from CP47 to RC is sufficiently fast.",5
222,We found an upper limit for this transfer rate of (20 ps).,5
223,"Slower rates result in a too slow decay of the excited states, which can only be corrected for by changing the energy levels of the secondary and tertiary radical pairs in the RC.",5
224,The contribution of each compartment to the total decay of the emission is shown in Fig. 10b.,8
225,"The ingrowth of population of each radical pair in CP47–RC is now much slower than in RC, which is because the excited states distribution is shifted towards CP47.",5
226,The main conclusion of this section is that good fits of the excited state decay can be obtained by a reversible radical pair model coupled to two subsequent relaxed radical pair states.,4
227,"If the energy levels of the three radical pairs do not change as a result of the addition of CP47, then the energy transfer between CP47 and RC does not limit the overall kinetics.",4
228,The slowing down of the trapping kinetics upon the addition of CP47 is explained by a shift of the excited state distribution towards CP47.,4
229,The analysis of transient difference absorption and time-resolved emission data revealed a multiexponential decay of the excited states in the PS II RC.,4
230,"Typical trapping lifetimes in the RC are 2–3, 30–40 and 350–450 ps.",5
231,"Multiexponential trapping in the PS II RC was also observed in earlier experiments, as well as in CP47–RC (this work) and PS II core preparations.",1
232,Initially it was thought that the wide spread of trapping times is due to sample heterogeneity and/or to a wide distribution of the free energy difference of radical pair formation.,1
233,"Later it was suggested that radical pair formation induces a reorganization of the protein surroundings, which in turn reduces the energy level of the radical pair.",1
234,"Also secundary electron transfer reactions, e.g., from P to Chl, may reduce the free energy of the radical pair.",1
235,Our data are consistent with the following model.,1
236,Excitation energy rapidly equilibrates within the six central chlorines of RC.,5
237,"Some or most equilibration takes place in about 100 fs, the remainder within a few ps at most.",5
238,Then initial charge separation takes place in 2–3 ps.,5
239,"The red shifted position of the 2–3 ps component in the transient absorption (400, 695 and 543 nm excitation) and time-resolved emission (400 and 680 nm excitation) indicates that initial charge separation starts from a red exciton state in the RC.",5
240,"This was already suggested in the literature based on the low temperature photon echo, site-directed mutagenesis, Stark spectroscopy and pump–probe measurements.",3
241,It is most likely that the first radical pair consists of the ChlPheo pair.,4
242,The first charge separation generates a radical pair state of about equal energy as that of the singlet excited state of the primary electron donor.,5
243,This makes recombination back to excited state highly possible.,4
244,After charge recombination the excitation is equilibrated over all central chlorines in RC.,5
245,"This defines the blue shift (relatively to the 2–3 ps DAS) of the 30–40 ps component in fluorescence which is observed at 400, 665 and 680 nm excitation.",5
246,The process of energy transfer from the peripheral Chls also contributes to this phase.,5
247,"It is possible that the 30–40 ps trapping phase originates from electron transfer from P to Chl, thus creating the PPheo radical pair.",5
248,"If this interpretation is correct, then this process would be considerably slower than in the purple bacterial RC, where this process takes place in about 3 ps.",4
249,It would also mean that the 3 ps phases in the RCs of PS II and purple bacteria have different origins.,4
250,The third trapping lifetime on the 350–450 ps time scale can be interpreted by a lowering of the energy level of PPheo radical pair due to conformational changes of the protein surroundings.,4
251,"The fact that this phase, rather prominent in the time-resolved emission experiments, gives rise to only very minor absorbance changes is consistent with this idea.",4
252,The data of the X-ray structures indicate that the chlorophylls of CP47 are located at considerable distances from the chlorophylls and pheophytins of the RC.,1
253,"The shortest distance is 21.3 Å, between Chl43 of CP47 and Pheo of the PS II RC.",1
254,"This will lead to slow energy transfer between CP47 and RC, also because the excitation energy will be rapidly delocalized over the 16 Chls of CP47 and the six central Chls and Pheos of the PS II RC.",1
255,"Thus, one should expect to observe this component as a relatively slow phase in the time-resolved spectroscopy data.",7
256,We indeed observed slower lifetimes for the excited states decays in CP47–RC.,8
257,"However, the data analysis based on the kinetic model leads to the conclusion that the intrinsic time for energy transfer from CP47 to RC does not limit the trapping kinetics.",4
258,"According to this analysis, the upper limit for this transfer is about 20 ps.",5
259,This analysis was based on the assumption that the energy levels and rate constants between the various compartments was identical for processes within the RC in the PS II RC and CP47–RC preparations.,6
260,"In other words, charge separation is assumed to occur in identical ways in both preparations.",6
261,"While there is no solid experimental evidence that would argue in favour or against this assumption, it does reflect the most simple model for charge separation in PS II.",6
262,An upper limit of about 20 ps was defined for the intrinsic time constant for energy transfer from CP47 to the RC.,6
263,Only a few ‘linker’ chlorophylls from CP47 are directly coupled with the RC chlorines  energy transfer.,1
264,"To obtain the time constant of energy transfer between the coupled pigments the value 20 ps must be corrected for the number of Chls in CP47 and the number of ‘linker’ chlorophylls, which gives 2.6 ps assuming 16 Chls in CP47, two of which are ‘linker’ Chls.",3
265,This value is of the order of the general equilibration time in the CP47 antenna.,8
266,"It may become slightly longer if the excited states of the ‘linker’ chlorophylls are populated to a larger extent than expected from a random distribution, for instance because they are red-shifted or are involved in exciton states that delocalize the main exciton state predominantly on these chlorophylls (which would also be caused by their relatively low site energies).",4
267,"According to the X-ray structures, the linker chlorophylls are ideally oriented for energy transfer to Pheo, supporting our conclusion about the fast rate of this process.",1
268,"We calculated the difference between energy transfer rates from the nearest linker chl of CP47 (Chl43) to Pheo, and from ChlZ to Pheo, based on the Förster formula.",3
269,"The shorter distance and the more favorable orientation of the first pair of molecules suggests a ten times faster energy transfer rate from Chl43 to Pheo, in agreement with the parameters of our model.",5
270,"We note, however, that local differences in refractive index can have a significant influence on these rates.",1
271,"Because the charge separation in the RC is highly reversible and the rate of excitation equilibration between CP47 and the RC is fast, the excited states of the CP47 antenna remain populated all the time the excitation occurs in the CP47–RC complex.",4
272,The spectral properties of the CP47 antenna are also very important.,1
273,The fact that the average energy level of CP47 is lower than that of the RC helps to distribute the excited states towards the core antenna.,8
274,We have found that the intrinsic rate constant of energy transfer is of the same order as the initial rate of charge separation.,5
275,"These results indicate that energy transfer and trapping in CP47–RC is not transfer-to-the-trap limited, as it is in the purple bacterial RC-LH1 complex.",4
276,"However, it is also not really trap-limited, because some of the energy transfer processes occur on the same timescale, or are even slower than that of the primary charge separation reaction.",4
277,A unique property of Photosystem II is that it has a high oxidation potential.,1
278,"It would be reasonable to assume that to prevent oxidation of the antenna components and leaking away of the positive charge from the site of water oxidation, these components must be located at long distances from the RC.",1
279,The available structural data have shown that the CP47 chlorophylls are indeed located at distances of 21 Å or more.,1
280,"Our analysis, however, has shown that this does not prevent a fast excitation energy transfer between CP47 and RC, highlighting the light-harvesting function of CP47.",4
281,It is also clear that CP47 does not play a direct role in the stabilization of the charge separation.,8
282,"Crucial roles in the charge stabilization are currently explained by electron transfer, in the 20–30 ps time range, from P to Chl and by conformational changes, in about 300 ps, of the charged protein surroundings.",5
283,"At high light intensities, the rate of photosynthetic electron transport reaches a maximum.",1
284,This leads to changes in the PS II antenna system which ultimately give rise to a strongly increased decay of excited states  internal conversion into heat by a process known as non-photochemical quenching and by photodestruction of the D1 protein of the PS II RC.,1
285,Our results indicate that CP47 reduces the apparent rate constant of charge separation and acts as a temporary excitation storage system.,4
286,The excited levels of CP47 gradually contribute to the ingrowth of radical pair populations.,4
287,It is likely that the other PS II antenna complexes play similar roles.,7
288,"So, the fast rate constant of energy transfer between CP47 and RC helps to keep the excitation energy in the antenna system and the possibility to regulate the light need for PS II by means of the antenna.",4
289,"This means that the antenna has a dual function: (1) it increases the absorption cross-section,  it increases the amount of collected light; and (2) it reduces the oversaturation of energy transfer chain.",4
290,We remark that these properties are not unique for PS II.,4
291,"It was shown recently that the additional IsiA antenna attached to iron-stressed cyanobacterial PS I performs similar functions: an increase of the light-harvesting capacity of PS I, and at the same time photoprotection for PS II.",1

4,We explored the suitability of a rigid-body DMA-based model potential to locate the most stable 1∶1 and 1∶2 adrenaline-water clusters.,3
5,"The model potential was able to locate all relevant 1∶1 clusters, but failed to find the most stable 1∶2 cluster.",5
6,This paper is part of a combined theoretical/experimental study of the catecholamine neurotransmitters.,1
7,"Previous work in this series include the investigation of the conformational landscapes of noradrenaline (NA), the simplest catecholamine neurotransmitter, and of singly hydrated NA.",1
8,The current work focuses on the adrenaline (A)/pseudoadrenaline (PA) pair.,9
9,"Noradrenaline has one chiral centre (the C atom, see Fig. 1 for the labelling of the atoms), and thus occurs in two spectroscopically identical chiral forms ( and ).",1
10,Adrenaline/pseudoadrenaline is formed by the replacement of one of the hydrogens of the terminal NH group by a methyl group.,1
11,"This makes the N atom chiral as well, which leads to the existence of two diastereoisomers: adrenaline (12/12) and pseudoadrenaline (12/12).",1
12,"A biomolecule's molecular shape plays a crucial role in its transport properties, its selectivity and function, and its receptor binding properties.",1
13,Its shape and conformation result from a delicate balance of intramolecular and environmental influences.,1
14,The study of gas-phase biomolecules is essential in order to differentiate the relative importance of the intrinsic and environmental influences on the biomolecule's conformation.,2
15,"In this article we provide a full theoretical characterisation of the neutral conformers of adrenaline and pseudoadrenaline in the gas phase, and provide a first investigation of the 1∶1 and 1∶2 hydrates of adrenaline.",9
16,"The functional groups of the catecholamine neurotransmitters (the catecholic hydroxyls, the chain OH and NH groups, and the π electron cloud) provide many possible water-binding sites.",1
17,"For the most stable NA conformer (AG1a), we located as many as eleven different AG1a–HO structures.",1
18,"To find the most stable hydrates, one should not only investigate clusters involving the most stable conformer, but one has to consider several of the low-lying conformers, as the interaction with water may change the relative stability of the conformers.",2
19,"In pseudoephedrine, for example, hydration results in a substantial rearrangement of its conformational landscape, altering the conformation at the global minimum from an extended (Aga) to a folded (Gga) conformation.",1
20,"In addition, the number of local minima increases steeply with the number of constituents in the cluster.",1
21,"Consequently, a full study of the adrenaline hydrates will be a formidable task.",1
22,"In this paper, we present the initial investigation of the 1∶1 and 1∶2 adrenaline hydrates.",9
23,"We investigate the different water-binding sites, and we comment on the most appropriate theoretical methodology to compute the relative stability of hydrates containing different adrenaline conformers.",9
24,"In addition, we explore the suitability of force-field calculations using a DMA (distributed multipole analysis)-based rigid-body model potential for scanning the potential energy surface of the hydrates.",0
25,The catechol OH groups have two possible orientations forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond: C- (the catechol hydrogens are  with respect to the C–H group) and C- (the catechol hydrogens are  with respect to the C–H group).,1
26,"There is, in fact, a third orientation for the catechol OH groups.",1
27,"In this one the catechol hydrogens point away from each other, preventing the catechol OH groups to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond.",1
28,"This orientation was also identified as a local minimum on the potential energy surface of catechol, and caffeic acid (which consists of a catechol moiety and a propenoate side chain).",1
29,It is however much less favourable than the orientations forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond.,1
30,We have therefore not considered this particular orientation of the catechol OH groups.,1
31,We first explored the conformational landscapes of adrenaline and pseudoadrenaline holding the catechol OH groups in the C- orientation.,9
32,"To provide starting structures for geometry optimisations, the  = (C–C–C–C),  = (C–C–C–N),  = (C–C–N–C) torsion angles were initially set to 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240° and 300°, and  = (C–C–O–H) was set to 60°, 180° and 300°.",6
33,"For ,  and  we initially used torsion angle step sizes of 60°.",6
34,"As the eclipsed conformations were found not to be local minima on the potential energy surface, part of the conformational search considered only staggered conformations.",6
35,The resulting conformations were subjected to HF/6-31G* geometry optimisations.,6
36,The geometries of all conformers with energies less than 20 kJ mol above the global minimum were re-optimised with density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP functional and the 6-31+G* basis set.,6
37,The C- conformers of the ten most stable A and of the ten most stable PA conformers were located using B3LYP/6-31+G*.,6
38,One of the A C- conformers (AG3a-2) appeared to be unstable.,8
39,The relative energies of the resulting nineteen A and twenty PA conformers were evaluated by single-point MP2/6-31+G* and MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations.,6
40,"Zero-point energies (scaled by 0976). and scaled (0976. for OH, 0956. for NH) harmonic vibrational frequencies were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory.",6
41,The A–HO and PA–HO structures considered in this work were optimised with B3LYP/6-31+G*.,6
42,The interaction energies were corrected for BSSE (basis set superposition error) by using the counterpoise procedure.,3
43,The deformation energies were taken into account as well.,3
44,"These are computed as the difference of the energy of A/PA (or HO) at the geometry the monomer adopts in the complex, and the energy of the free molecule at its equilibrium geometry .",6
45,"As discussed in our recent paper on NA–HO, there are two possible choices for the geometry of the free adrenaline.",1
46,"If one is interested in how strongly water binds to a  conformer, then the equilibrium geometry of this particular conformer should be used.",1
47,The resulting interaction energy is called the  water interaction energy (Δ).,1
48,"However, if one wants to compute relative interaction energies of A–HO complexes consisting of different A conformers, then one should use the equilibrium energy of the most stable conformer.",1
49,"Relative energies calculated like this are corrected for BSSE, in contrast to relative energies based on the A–HO total energies.",1
50,"Unless specified otherwise, we will use the second definition in the current paper.",3
51,"To provide the interaction energies at 0 K, Δ, the (harmonic, scaled by 0.976) zero-point energies (ZPE) of AW and the separated fragments (computed in the harmonic approximation) were taken into account: Δ = Δ + ZPEAW − ZPEA(global)() − ZPEW()(For the specific water interaction energy , one should take the zero-point energy of adrenaline at the equilibrium geometry of the particular conformer one is interested in, instead of that of the global minimum).",6
52,"In the current paper, the interaction energies are listed as  (=−Δ) and  (=−Δ), so that positive values denote an attractive interaction.",6
53,"The interaction energies of π-type hydrogen bonds are difficult to evaluate accurately, due to the large contribution of the dispersion energy to the interaction, which is known to converge slowly with addition of high angular momentum polarisation functions.",1
54,Current standard density functionals cannot evaluate the dispersion energy quantitatively.,1
55,"MP2 in principle allows the calculation of dispersion-type interactions; however, MP2 calculations with large basis sets readily become intractable for the size of systems studied in this work.",1
56,"An earlier study on indole-HO and methylindole-HO showed that MP2 calculations employing the compact - DZP basis set do give accurate interaction energies, for conventional  π-type H-bonded complexes.",3
57,We have therefore computed the structures and geometries of the π-bonded complexes with MP2/DZP.,9
58,The effect of BSSE on the intermolecular geometry can be quite large when using the DZP basis set.,1
59,"To correct for this in an approximate way, the hydrogen-bond distances in these complexes were corrected for BSSE by numerically locating the distance for which the counterpoise-corrected  has its maximum.",6
60,The electronic-structure calculations were performed with Gaussian 98 (revisions A.9 and A.11) and NWChem (version 4.1) on clusters of 1.7 GHz Pentium 4 and 2.0 GHz dual Xeon PCs running Linux.,3
61,An Origin 2000 and a cluster of Sun 900 MHz V880 servers at the HiPerSPACE Computing Centre at University College London were used as well.,3
62,"As usual, only the valence electrons were correlated.",3
63,Gaussian's “ultrafine” integration grid was used for the DFT calculations.,6
64,The optimisations were converged using Gaussian's “tight” criteria for the cutoffs on forces and step size.,6
65,"The model potential used, dubbed MP2fit/DMA, was developed in a study on uracil-water, and used recently in an investigation of protonated nicotine interacting with water and a third body.",1
66,"It consists of an atom–atom 6–exp potential to describe the repulsion and dispersion terms, and a DMA (distributed multipole analysis) model for the electrostatic contribution.",1
67,"All individual terms of this potential are pairwise additive, and thus, it can readily be extended to complexes containing more than two molecules.",1
68,"The potential has different parameters for each atom type (C, N, O, H), and it distinguishes between hydrogens attached to C, polar hydrogens (attached to O or N), and water hydrogens.",1
69,"The DMA model uses atomic multipoles up to hexadecapole, derived from  wavefunctions (MP2/6-311++G(2d,2p) for water, MP2/6-311G** for adrenaline), and includes all terms in the atom–atom multipole expansion up to .",1
70,The DMA was derived from the wavefunctions calculated with Gaussian 98 by using the GDMA program.,3
71,"As the MP2fit/DMA potential is a rigid-body potential, the DMA for adrenaline needs to be recomputed for each different conformer.",1
72,The monomer geometries used were obtained by geometry optimisations at the same level of theory as used to calculate the DMAs.,3
73,The model potential calculations were done with the program Orient.,3
74,Further details on the potential model are provided in .,1
75,The structures of the sixteen most stable A and PA conformers (based on the single-point MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ energies) are shown in Fig. 2.,8
76,"To classify the A and PA conformers we used the same notation as employed in our previous study on NA, which is based on previous studies on 2-amino-1-phenylethanol and the ephedra:",1
77,"() The A/G notation denotes the arrangements ( or ) of the C–C–C–N and O–C–C–N atom chains, respectively.",6
78,"() In NA, which contains an NH group instead of the NH(CH) group in A and PA, the AG and GG conformers have either a short OH⋯N (AG1, GG1), or a short NH⋯O (AG2/3, GG2/3) contact.",6
79,(The AG2/3 and GG2/3 families differ depending on which amino H atom is involved in the H-bonding).,6
80,"In A and PA, the corresponding AG2/3 and GG2/3 families will have an NH⋯O (if the free hydrogen in the corresponding NA structure is methylated) or a CH⋯O contact (if the hydrogen-bonding H atom is methylated).",6
81,() The catechol OH groups can have two different orientations (C- and C-) and the side chain can be above or below the ring.,6
82,"This is notated by “a” (C-, above plane), “b” (C-, above plane), “c” (C-, below plane) and “d” (C-, below plane).",6
83,C- and C- conformations corresponding to the same side chain conformation differ slightly in energy due to interaction of the catechol hydroxyl groups with the side chain functional groups.,6
84,This was also observed for caffeic acid for which the C- conformers were found to have a slightly lower energy than the C- conformers.,1
85,"In A and PA the “a” conformers, which have a C- orientation of the catecholic hydroxyls, appear to be favoured.",8
86,"The conformers with an intramolecular OH⋯N hydrogen bond (AG1, GG1) are more stable than the NH⋯O hydrogen-bonded structures (AG2, AG3, GG2).",8
87,"This is in agreement with the larger polarity of OH as compared to NH, as well as with studies on the hydrogen-bonding abilities of oxygen and nitrogen in different hydrogen-bonding environments (oxygens covalently bound to two non-hydrogen atoms of which at least one is sp hybridised and hydrogen bonds to monocyclic aromatic heterocycles), which showed that nitrogen atoms are stronger hydrogen-bond acceptors than oxygens.",4
88,Rablen  likewise found that nitrogens are better hydrogen-bond acceptors than sp-hybridised oxygens.,1
89,"(However, Vargas  found that NH⋯O interactions are more stable than NH⋯N interactions, which is in contradiction with the presumed larger hydrogen-bond acceptor ability of N as compared to O).",1
90,"In our previous study on noradrenaline we found that the twenty most stable NA conformers are of the AG or GG types (AG1, GG1, AG2, AG3 and GG2).",1
91,"The twenty most stable A conformers (based on the B3LYP energies) include the equivalents of the AG1, GG1 and AG3 conformers found for NA, a second AG3 family and a GA family.",8
92,"For completeness, we have also optimised the structures of the AG2 and GG2 adrenaline conformers with B3LYP/6-31+G* (followed by single-point MP2/6-31+G* and MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations).",6
93,"The relative energies of the resulting 27 A conformers, listed in decreasing order of stability based on the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ energies, are collected in Table S1 of the ESI.",8
94,"The twenty most stable PA conformers (based on the B3LYP energies) include the equivalent conformers of the AG1, GG1 and AG2 conformers found for NA, as well as a GA and GG3 family, which were not among the most stable NA conformers.",5
95,"We have also calculated the relative energies of the AG3 and GG2 families, which were not among the twenty most stable PA conformers.",9
96,"The relative energies Δ() and Δ() of the resulting 28 PA conformers, in decreasing order of stability based on the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ Δ() values, are listed in Table S2 of the ESI.",8
97,"At the B3LYP level of theory, PA is slightly more stable than A; this order is reversed however at the MP2 level of theory.",8
98,"Even though A and PA are roughly isoenergetic, it is not likely that there will be interconversion between the two diastereoisomers in supersonic expansion experiments, as interconversion  umbrella-inversion of the chiral amino group is expected to have a high barrier.",7
99,"We have calculated the HF/6-31G* relaxed potential energy profile for the umbrella inversion starting from the AG1a conformer, and optimised the geometry of the transition state for this process (see Fig. 3).",6
100,The barrier height for this process is calculated to be 26.6 kJ mol.,5
101,"As studies on conformational relaxation in supersonic jets indicate that barriers larger than 6 kJ mol are sufficient to prevent conformational relaxation, it is very unlikely that A ↔ PA interconversion will take place at the low temperatures of supersonic jet experiments.",4
102,There are significant differences between the B3LYP and MP2 relative energies of A and PA.,8
103,"This is demonstrated more effectively in Figs. 4 and 5, which show the relative energies Δ() of the A and PA conformers grouped together in their conformational families.",8
104,"B3LYP underestimates the relative stability of the GG1 conformers, which contain a short N–H⋯π (A) or CH⋯π (PA) contact, of the GG2 conformers, which also contain a short N–H⋯π (PA) or CH⋯π (A) contact, and of the GA conformers, which contain a short NH⋯π interaction.",5
105,"Thus, for conformers that contain π-type interactions, B3LYP is less reliable for calculating relative energies.",4
106,"Although B3LYP predicts the adrenaline GG1a conformer to be less stable than AG1a by 2.4 kJ mol (3.0 kJ mol after zero-point vibrational corrections), at the single-point MP2/aug- cc-pVDZ level of theory this energy gap has decreased to a mere 0.49 kJ mol (1.06 kJ mol after vibrational corrections).",5
107,"The narrow energy gap between the adrenaline AG1 and GG1 conformers was also observed for NA and APE (2-amino-1-phenylethanol), the benzene analogue of NA.",8
108,"However, whereas both AG1 and GG1 APE conformers were observed experimentally, the NA experiments, surprisingly showed only one NA conformer, which was assigned as AG1a.",1
109,"(In the NA experiments, gas-phase NA was generated  laser ablation rather than evaporation using a heated nozzle, which may influence the observed conformer distribution).",3
110,"Similarly, the most intense band in the UV spectrum of APE was assigned to the extended AG conformer, even though MP2 calculations predicted the GG structure to be slightly more stable.",1
111,"As different levels of theory yield different results on the relative stability of AG1a and GG1a, assignment of AG1a or GG1a as the global minimum cannot be based on the calculated energy differences alone.",2
112,It is likely that also for adrenaline the AG1a conformer will be the preferred structure.,7
113,"However, as for NA, this issue cannot be resolved without spectroscopic investigation.",1
114,"To aid future spectroscopic assignment, we have listed the harmonic frequencies of the hydride stretches of the AG1a and GG1a conformers, calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory, in Table 1.",8
115,Frequencies of the other conformers are available upon request.,1
116,"The NH stretch modes have near-zero intensity, and cannot be expected to be observed experimentally.",8
117,"One of the catechol OH groups is hydrogen bonded to its neighbour, resulting in a red-shifted stretch mode.",5
118,"The “free” catechol OH stretch band, (OH), and the stretch band of the hydrogen-bonded catechol OH, (OH–O), occur at nearly identical frequencies/intensities in AG1a and GG1a, and therefore cannot be used to distinguish between the two conformers.",5
119,"Unfortunately, also the frequency of the hydrogen-bonded side-chain OH stretch mode, OH–N, is very similar in AG1a and GG1a, though the AG1a mode has a larger intensity.",5
120,"The PA OH–N mode, on the other hand, is sufficiently different in AG1a and GG1a to aid assignment of future observed conformers.",5
121,"Fig. 6 compares the relative energies Δ() of the corresponding NA, A and PA conformers obtained from single-point MP2 calculations.",8
122,The adrenaline AG2 conformers are much less stable than the corresponding NA and PA conformers.,8
123,This is because the A conformer has a CH⋯O instead of an NH⋯O interaction.,4
124,"Similarly, the pseudoadrenaline AG3 conformers are destabilised by the replacement of an intramolecular NH⋯O by a less favourable CH⋯O interaction.",5
125,"For the GG2 family both A and PA are destabilised with respect to the corresponding NA conformers, as the NH⋯π interaction is replaced by a CH⋯π contact in A, while in PA the NH⋯O interaction is replaced by a CH⋯O contact.",5
126,We have computed ten different AG1c–HO and ten different AG3b–HO structures.,9
127,"AG1c belongs to the most stable conformer family, AG1, whereas AG3b belongs to the first family of conformers with an intramolecular NH⋯O hydrogen bond.",1
128,Table 2 shows the computed interaction energies of the AG1c–HO hydrates.,8
129,"Their structures, located with B3LYP/6-31+G*, are shown in Fig. 7.",8
130,"Previous studies on the hydration of ethanolamine neurotransmitters and their analogues found two different categories of 1∶1 hydrates:  structures, in which the water inserts between two functional groups of the host molecule, and  structures, formed by the addition of a water molecule to one of the functional groups.",1
131,"The global minimum is an insertion structure for 1∶1 clusters of 2-aminoethanol with phenol, and for the 1∶1 hydrates of 2-phenoxy-ethanol, APE, and the ephedrine/pseudoephedrine pair.",1
132,"However, the most stable 1∶1 hydrate of NA (which has a catechol ring instead of the benzene ring in 2-phenoxy- ethanol, APE and the ephedra), was found to be an  structure; the water molecule binds to one of the catechol OH groups, indicating that the hydroxyl groups of the catechol ring provide a more attractive water-binding site than the ethanolamine side chain.",1
133,"In the current study we find that this addition structure is also the most stable 1∶1 hydrate of the AG1c adrenaline conformer (see Table 2 and Fig. 7): in this structure (labelled catOH–O), the water binds to one of the catechol OH groups to form an OH⋯OH⋯OH daisy chain of hydrogen bonds.",5
134,A related structure (catO–HO) with a similar hydrogen-bond chain but with water acting as the hydrogen bond donor is distinctly less stable.,8
135,"There are two different insertion-type structures, with water being located either between the chain OH and NH groups (OH–OH–N) or between the two catechol OH groups (catOH–OH–catO).",1
136,"The two insertion structures have large monomer deformation energies, reflecting the energy penalty associated with opening up the dihedral angle between the two functional groups, to make space for the water molecule.",5
137,"Despite this energy penalty, the OH–OH–N insertion structure is only slightly less stable than the global minimum (catOH–O).",5
138,"The water molecule can further bind to the side-chain NH group (NH–O), to either of the lone pairs of the side-chain oxygen (the two O–HO structures), and to the π-electron cloud of the catechol ring.",1
139,"In the first π-bonded structure, OH–OH–π, the water forms an additional hydrogen bond with this OH group.",1
140,"In the second π-bonded structure, OH–π, the water binds to the other face to the catechol ring, where there is no possibility to form an additional strong hydrogen-bonded contact (although there is some additional stabilisation due to the two CH⋯O interactions), and this structure is therefore less stable than the OH–OH–π minimum.",1
141,Table 2 shows that the O–HO–π structure is not stable on the B3LYP/6-31+G* potential energy surface.,8
142,"As the effect of BSSE on the intermolecular geometry can be quite large in π-bonded complexes, we re-optimised the hydrogen-bond distances of the two π-bonded structures with counterpoise corrections.",9
143,The resulting interaction energies are given in parentheses in Table 2.,8
144,"This re-optimisation has negligible effect on the B3LYP results, but it significantly increases the MP2/DZP interaction energy, thereby further increasing the discrepancy between the MP2 and DFT results.",5
145,Fig. 7 shows that the re-optimisation significantly increases the MP2 hydrogen-bond distances.,8
146,"Fig. 7 shows two nearly iso-energetic catO–HO structures, just differing in the position of the free (not hydrogen-bonded) water hydrogen, which can be on either side of the aromatic ring.",8
147,"To investigate the barrier for interconversion between the (a) and (b) structure, we have calculated the relaxed potential energy profile for rotation of the free water hydrogen around the O–O axis.",0
148,"As can be seen in Fig. 8, the catO–HO (a) minimum is very shallow, with an almost non-existent barrier for conversion to the (b) structure, and it is therefore surprising that the (a) structure was found at all!",8
149,Also shown in Fig. 8 is the counterpoise-corrected potential energy profile.,8
150,"The counterpoise-corrected barrier, though larger than the uncorrected barrier, is still only 0.8 kJ mol.",5
151,It can therefore be expected that the two minima will be indistinguishable even at the very low vibrational temperatures of supersonic jet experiments.,7
152,"Indeed, plots of the H-density derived from diffusion Monte Carlo studies on hydrogen-bonded complexes like uracil–(HO) ( = 1–3) and cytosine–(HO) show a large-amplitude, banana-shaped, zero-point vibrational motion of the free water hydrogen atoms, covering the corresponding minima differing only in the position of the free water hydrogen (above or below the plane of the biomolecule).",1
153,This delocalised zero-point motion indicates that even at 0 K these minima cannot be differentiated experimentally.,1
154,Table 3 shows the computed interaction energies of the 1∶1 AG3b–HO hydrates.,8
155,"Their structures, located with B3LYP/6-31+G*, are displayed in Fig. 9.",8
156,The AG3b hydrates in which water binds to the catechol OH groups are very similar in structure and interaction energy to their corresponding AG1c hydrates.,1
157,"However, because AG3b has an NH⋯O hydrogen bond instead of the OH⋯N bond in AG1c, hydrates in which water binds to the side chain can be radically different.",1
158,"Thus, the insertion structure in which the water molecule is located between the side-chain OH and NH functional groups contains an OH⋯OH⋯N hydrogen-bond chain in AG1c–HO, but an O⋯HO⋯NH hydrogen-bond chain in AG3b–HO resulting in a 5 kJ mol weaker interaction.",5
159,"The N⋯HO interaction in the AG1c NH–O hydrate, on the other hand, is replaced by a stronger N⋯HO hydrogen bond in AG3b–HO.",5
160,The specific water interaction energy (32 kJ mol) shows that this is the most favourable water-binding site.,5
161,"The N–HO AG3b–HO structure is of comparable stability to the most stable AG1c–HO structure (catOH–O), despite the 2.5 kJ mol smaller stability of the AG3b conformer.",5
162,We re-optimised the hydrogen-bond lengths with counterpoise corrections for a selection of the AG3b–HO minima (see Table 3 for the resulting interaction energies and Fig. 9 for the hydrogen-bond distances).,6
163,"The effect is very small for the B3LYP calculations, but the MP2/DZP interaction energies are increased by 2.2–2.4 kJ mol.",5
164,"Unexpectedly, the effect is of similar magnitude for the π-bonded and conventional hydrogen-bonded structures.",8
165,"The catOH–O hydrates of AG1a and GG1a, the two most stable adrenaline conformers, are the most likely candidates for experimental observation, since the catOH–O hydrate was found to be the observed NA–HO structure.",4
166,Table 4 lists the calculated infrared frequencies of these two structures.,8
167,(Infrared frequencies of the other hydrates are available upon request).,1
168,"Comparison of the frequencies of the bare molecule (Table 1) with those of the hydrates (Table 4) reveals a strong red shift of the (OH) frequency, accompanied by a large increase in intensity.",8
169,"This is due to hydrogen bonding with the water molecule, as was also observed for NA–HO.",5
170,"Finally, we would like to comment on the calculation of the interaction energies.",1
171,"As explained in the Methodology section, the interaction energies should be computed relative to the most stable conformer, more precisely, the most stable conformer for the method and basis set used.",1
172,"For B3LYP/6-31+G* and single-point MP2 calculations with the 6-31+G* or aug-cc-pVDZ basis sets this is the AG1a conformer, but for MP2/DZP this is the GG1a conformer.",6
173,"Thus, the B3LYP/6-31+G* interaction energy of a particular AG1a–HO hydrate will be the same as its specific water interaction energy, but the corresponding MP2/DZP interaction energy will contain an energy penalty term reflecting the difference in stability of the AG1a and GG1a conformers.",6
174,"In Table 5 we have listed the specific interaction energies, and , for the catOH–O hydrates of AG1a and GG1a.",8
175,"As can be seen, B3LYP/6-31+G* favours the AG1a hydrate, whereas MP2/DZP favours the GG1a hydrate.",5
176,"To understand the effect of water on the geometry of the biomolecule, one has to study clusters containing numerous water molecules.",1
177,"However, there are several major problems with geometry optimisations of molecular clusters consisting of more than two constituents.",1
178,"Firstly, the number of local minima increases steeply with the number of constituents in the cluster, and secondly, the convergence of the calculations slows down due to the coupling of inter- and intramolecular degrees of freedom.",1
179,"In addition, the individual energy calculations become much more computationally demanding.",1
180,"Thus, to find all possible minima for the A–(HO) clusters of several low-lying adrenaline conformers using methods like DFT or MP2 becomes a near-impossible task.",2
181,"We therefore need to find a computationally cheap, but reliable, method for exploring the potential energy surface of the A–(HO) (n > 1) clusters.",2
182,"The semi-empirical AM1 and PM3 methods are not suitable for this, as these methods failed to accurately predict the structure and relative stabilities of the different serotonin conformers.",1
183,"In this section, we explore the suitability of force-field calculations using the MP2fit/DMA rigid-body model potential for scanning the potential energy surface of the hydrates.",9
184,"The DMA electrostatic model of this potential accurately describes non-spherical features of the charge distribution, such as π-electron clouds and lone pairs, which play an important role in establishing the water-binding sites in the biomolecule.",6
185,"The model potential yields the interaction between two rigid monomer fragments, and thus, the MP2fit/DMA results should be compared to the B3LYP and MP2  water interaction energies.",6
186,We will first investigate the performance of the model potential for locating the 1∶1 hydrates of the AG1c and AG3b conformers.,9
187,The resulting interaction energies are included in Tables 2 and 3.,8
188,The results are very encouraging.,1
189,"All minima are found (we failed to locate one of the two O–HO AG1c hydrates, but as mentioned above, structures that only differ in the free H orientation are basically the same structure).",5
190,"The model potential generally yields interaction energies that are 2–4 kJ mol larger than the corresponding B3LYP values, except for the π-bonded structures and the AG3c N–HO minimum, for which the model potential yields much larger interaction energies.",5
191,"The discrepancy between the DFT and MP2fit/DMA results for the π-bonded structures is due to the inability of DFT to properly describe these structures, rather than deficiencies in the model potential.",4
192,This is confirmed by the good agreement between the MP2fit/DMA and MP2/DZP results for the π-bonded structures.,4
193,"The discrepancy for the N-HO structure indicates a possible deficiency in the potential's parameters for N. The repulsion and dispersion parameters of O and H were adjusted to yield good agreement with MP2 data on the minima and transition states of uracil-water, but the N parameters were not attuned to  data (they were derived from empirical fits to organic crystal structures and heats of sublimation), and thus, the N parameters may not be optimal for reproducing the gas-phase structures.",1
194,Of particular interest are the insertion-type structures.,1
195,"Because the MP2fit/DMA is a rigid-body potential, the adrenaline molecule cannot adjust its geometry to facilitate the water molecule to migrate between two of its functional groups.",1
196,"Both insertion structures (OH–OH–N/O–HO–HN and catOH–OH–catO) were found with the model potential calculations, demonstrating that the rigidity of the model potential does not prevent these structures to be found.",5
197,"Earlier work on uracil-(HO) and uracil-(HO) showed that the MP2fit/DMA potential yields good agreement with  (MP2/DZP) interaction energies and hydrogen-bond distances, despite the lack of many-body terms in the potential model.",1
198,"As the three-body contribution is about 25% for uracil-(HO), this indicates that the model potential's repulsion and dispersion parameters, which have been determined by empirical parameterisation, must have absorbed some of the water-water non-additivity.",1
199,"In this section, we investigate the model potential suitability for A–(HO) clusters.",9
200,"We created AG3b–(HO) starting structures by systematically varying the position of the two water molecules in steps of 2 Å, in three orthogonal directions.",6
201,Two different rotational orientations of the water molecules were considered.,6
202,Structures in which one of the moieties overlapped with another one (as indicated by an intermolecular distance smaller than 1.2 Å) were discarded.,6
203,Structures in which a water molecule was too far from the adrenaline molecule (closest intermolecular contact larger than 4 Å) were discarded as well.,6
204,The geometries of the resulting 33 540 geometries were optimised with the MP2fit/DMA model potential.,3
205,One geometry optimisation took approximately 1 minute of CPU time on a 1.7 GHz Pentium 4 PC.,3
206,"We found as many as 170 different minima; however, some of these are very similar in structure.",8
207,"Fig. 10 lists the twelve most stable structures found with MP2fit/DMA, in decreasing order of stability.",8
208,"Structures 1, 4 and 11 are  structures: the two water molecules bridge the adrenaline chain oxygen and nitrogen functional groups.",5
209,"In all these, the adrenaline chain oxygen acts as a hydrogen-bond acceptor.",5
210,Zwier suggested that such water bridges may be a preferred structural motif in cases where it can be formed.,1
211,"Structures 1 and 4 are very similar, with just small differences in the position of the free water hydrogens.",8
212,Structure 11 has a different hydrogen-bonding pattern than 1 and 4 (O⋯HO⋯HOH⋯N instead of O⋯HOH⋯OH⋯N).,8
213,"In structures 2, 3, 5 and 6 the water molecules form a dimer structure, which is bonded to the adrenaline nitrogen.",8
214,We call these  structures.,1
215,"The different dimer addition structures just differ in the position of the free water hydrogens, or in the direction of the hydrogen-bond chain itself.",8
216,"The remaining five structures are  structures, formed by the addition of the two water molecules to two different functional groups of adrenaline: In structures 7 and 10 one water molecule binds to the nitrogen, while the other binds to the chain oxygen, whereas in structures 8 and 9 the second water binds to one of the catechol hydroxyl groups.",8
217,"Structure 12 is a  structure: the first water molecule is inserted between the chain O and the NH group, whereas the second water molecule is added to the nitrogen.",8
218,"We have reoptimised the structures of these twelve hydrates, and of two lower-lying hydrates (23 and 28), with B3LYP/6-31+G*.",6
219,In structure 23 the two waters form a ring structure involving one of the catechol hydroxyls.,8
220,Structure 28 contains a water dimer bridging the chain OH and π-electron binding sites.,8
221,"Structure 23 obeys the basic structural principle of XW clusters in which X corresponds to an aromatic alcohol (catechol, in this case), which are equivalent to a water trimer in which one of the free hydrogens is replaced by the aromatic ring.",5
222,Table 6 compares the MP2fit/DMA and B3LYP specific water interaction energies.,8
223,"Most B3LYP-optimised structures are very similar to their corresponding MP2fit/DMA structures, but there are some important differences.",8
224,AW2-8 and AW2-9 converge to the same minimum when reoptimised with B3LYP.,5
225,Two other structures (5 and 7) are not stable on the B3LYP potential energy surface.,8
226,"Most worryingly though, we have found an additional structure with B3LYP (labelled AW2-global, see Fig. 10).",8
227,"In this structure, the two waters bridge the chain OH and NH functional groups.",8
228,"The adrenaline chain oxygen acts as a proton  (in contrast to the other bridge structures, 1, 4 and 11, in which the oxygen acts as an acceptor).",8
229,"To allow this particular water-binding arrangement, the OH group has to rotate by as much as 60° around the C–O bond, changing the hydroxyl hydrogen from a staggered to an eclipsed position with respect to the C hydrogen.",5
230,This internal rotation is not possible with the rigid-body MP2fit/DMA potential.,5
231,"Despite this large conformational distortion of adrenaline, costing 10 kJ mol, the AW2-global structure is the most stable AG3b–(HO) hydrate located in this study.",4
232,"In general, B3LYP gives smaller AG3b–(HO) interaction energies than MP2fit/DMA.",4
233,"Though it is possible that DFT underestimates the AG3b–(HO) interaction energies, it is unlikely that they are underestimated by as much as 20 kJ mol.",4
234,"Thus, it is more likely that MP2fit/DMA overestimates the interaction energies, even though the potential did not overestimate uracil-(HO) interaction energies.",4
235,"As the model potential proved unsuitable to locate the A–(HO) structures, further investigation of this problem has not been pursued.",1
236,"Even though environmental effects play an important role in modelling biological processes, an understanding of the intrinsic energetics of flexible biomolecules is essential for disentangling the relative importance of the intrinsic and environmental effects.",1
237,"The most stable adrenaline/pseudoadrenaline conformers, in the gas phase, are those forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds: both the extended AG1 and the folded GG1 conformers contain an intramolecular OH⋯N hydrogen bond.",5
238,"Naturally, under physiological conditions, adrenaline will not adopt its gas-phase geometry.",1
239,"The structure of adrenaline in blood will be affected by environmental factors such as protonation, solvation and interaction with other molecules present, whereas the structure of the neurotransmitter in its receptor binding site will be influenced by competing hydrogen-bonding interactions with binding-site residues.",1
240,"However, by studying the shape of biomolecules in the gas phase, the environmental effects can be eliminated, allowing the molecule-solvent interaction to be studied in a controlled environment.",1
241,"A recent computational study provided a prediction for the structure and function of G protein-coupled receptors, including the β1-adrenergic receptor.",1
242,"The study shows the two catechol OH groups forming hydrogen bonds with serine residues, whereas the chain hydroxyl and the amino group form hydrogen bonds with an aspartic acid, in good agreement with earlier mutation experiments.",1
243,"The study predicts that the catechol hydrogens point away from each other, an unfavourable orientation not considered in the current work.",1
244,Calculations show that this catechol group orientation is about 19 kJ mol higher in energy than corresponding conformers in which the catechol OH groups form an intramolecular hydrogen bond.,1
245,"Thus, environmental factors appear to have a profound effect on the structure of the neurotransmitter.",1
246,Our initial investigation of the adrenaline hydrates in this paper provides a first step in studying the environmental effects on the structure of adrenaline.,1
247,Hydration is believed to play an important role in the drug-receptor recognition process.,4
248,"It has been proposed that the water surrounding the neurotransmitter and its receptor invokes the initial recognition process, possibly by a change in the receptor geometry induced by the structure-breaking effects of the catechol ring.",1
249,In this study we have studied the 1∶1 hydrates of the AG1c and the 1∶1 and 1∶2 hydrates of the AG3b conformer.,9
250,"For a complete study of adrenaline hydration, one would have to include several of the low-lying conformers, as the interaction with water may change their relative stability, and one would have to look at larger clusters (containing more water molecules) as well.",1
251,"This is a formidable task, and would best be done in combination with an experimental study, which can provide guidance to the type of hydrates observed experimentally.",1
252,The current study shows the limitations of using a rigid-body potential for calculating the adrenaline hydrates.,4
253,"While the model potential did find all relevant 1∶1 hydrates, including the insertion-type structures, it failed to locate the most stable 1∶2 hydrate, characterised by a large internal rotation around the C–O bond.",5
254,"A similar effect was observed for protonated nicotine-(HO), Also for this system, the interaction with water induces a large conformational distortion, costing 12 kJ mol, which allows the two water molecules to bridge the pyridine and pyrrolidinium rings.",5
255,Good agreement with the DFT results was obtained only when the distorted nicotine geometry (and its corresponding DMA) was used in the MP2fit/DMA model potential calculations.,8
256,"Thus, the model potential calculations can only be used as a guiding tool to find the most stable hydrates, as its rigid-body character prevents any water-induced conformational changes.",4
257,The study of the hydrates of flexible biomolecules remains a difficult and computationally expensive task.,1
258,"In this study, we have investigated the conformational structures of adrenaline (A) and pseudoadrenaline (PA) at the MP2 and DFT levels of theory.",9
259,The calculations predict the extended AG1a and folded GG1a adrenaline conformers to be nearly isoenergetic.,5
260,The pseudoadrenaline AG1a conformer on the other hand is more stable than GG1a by 3 kJ mol.,5
261,It would be very interesting to see which A and PA conformers are formed in supersonic jet experiments.,1
262,We have explored the molecular structures of the 1∶1 hydrates of the AG1c and the 1∶1 and 1∶2 hydrates of the AG3b adrenaline conformer.,9
263,"In the most stable AG1c–HO structure, the water molecule is bound as a proton acceptor to the -OH catechol group, in a similar way as the most stable NA–HO structure observed and predicted by theory.",5
264,In the most stable AG3b–HO structure the water molecule is bound as a proton donor to the chain nitrogen.,5
265,"The MP2fit/DMA rigid-body model potential, which contains an accurate DMA model to describe the electrostatic energy contribution to the potential energy, correctly predicts all AG1c–HO and AG3b–HO structures.",8
266,"However, the model potential fails to locate the most stable AG3b–(HO) structure located with B3LYP.",8
267,"This structure is characterised by a large conformational distortion of the adrenaline moiety, which cannot be described by the rigid-body model potential.",4
268,This shows the limitation of rigid-body calculations in studies of biomolecular clusters.,4
269,"To aid future spectroscopic assignment, we have provided infrared frequencies of the OH and NH stretch modes of the two most stable adrenaline conformers, AG1a and GG1a, and their most plausible singly hydrated clusters.",4
0,Efficient evaluation of three-center two-electron integrals over Gaussian functions,9
1,The RI (resolution of the identity) technique achieves significant increases in efficiency for various molecular electronic structure methods.,3
2,This results from the approximation of four-center two-electron integrals by corresponding three-center integrals.,3
3,It is shown that the three-center integrals required can be evaluated with a much simpler algorithm than for the general case.,3
4,This further increases the advantage of RI procedures.,1
0,Miniaturised nucleic acid analysis,9
1,"The application of micro total analysis systems has grown exponentially over the past few years, particularly diversifying in disciplines related to bioassays.",2
2,"The primary focus of this review is to detail recent new approaches to sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification and detection within microfluidic devices or at the microscale level.",0
3,"We also introduce some applications that have as yet to be explored in a miniaturised environment, but should benefit from improvements in analytical efficiency and functionality when transferred to planar-chip formats.",0
4,"The studies described in this review were published in commonly available journals as well as in the proceedings of three major conferences relevant to microfluidics (Micro Total Analysis Systems, Transducers and The Nanotechnology Conference and Trade Show).",1
5,"Although an emphasis has been placed on papers published since 2002, pertinent articles preceding this publication year have also been included.",1
6,The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has succeeded in revolutionising the analysis of nucleic acids.,1
7,"Disciplines both directly and indirectly related to the life sciences can readily exploit PCR, and with various genome study initiatives increasingly making available sequence data, this trend is set to continue into the future.",1
8,Most striking has been the synonymous advent of real-time PCR and delivery of a robust quantitative gene measuring tool.,3
9,"However, the post-genome era brings with it new problems and exposes old fissures that have undermined the application of PCR.",3
10,The scaling-up of pre-existing procedures for higher throughput would be inappropriate for continuous environmental monitoring and population studies.,3
11,"Indeed, when attempted this approach reveals the necessary requirement to integrate gene analysis into a process that serves best to eliminate both sampling and experimental error.",1
12,"Miniaturisation of PCR integrated bioassays potentially possesses all of the desired qualities and comes with additional benefits relating to sample tracking, contamination, and savings in finances and time.",3
13,Long ignored issues relating to the meaningfulness of data are starting to be questioned.,3
14,"Biological matter is comprised from the unit of life, the cell, and gene analysis is portrayed in terms of gene abundance, presence, or absence, within a particular biological sample.",1
15,"Tissues are heterogeneous, in that many types of different cells co-exist within biological samples.",1
16,"However, most PCR experimental testing to date does not clearly relate the gene content measured to the contribution made by all specific cell types.",3
17,"Increasingly the need to analyse from the single cell is gaining in popularity, and once again the packaging and process offered by integrated miniaturised PCR offers great promise.",3
18,"Indeed, when considered alongside the potential to dissect the PCR process itself to understand more how to increase and maintain PCR efficiency, the miniaturisation of PCR and future PCR applications seem to become permanently entwined.",1
19,"The majority of developments in miniaturisation have stemmed from institutes with strong analytical, engineering, fabrication and optical specialisations.",1
20,The influx of interdisciplinary interest offers distinct and critical benefits to the application driven life sciences.,2
21,"Therefore, to allow researchers from engineering and life science backgrounds to reflect on the recent progress and to help traverse interdisciplinary boundaries, we have compiled a concise review of papers based around nucleic acid assay miniaturisation and microfluidic PCR, and set these against a framework of biological applications.",9
22,"The reader is also directed to other reviews covering either a wide range of applications, or specific fields such as DNA and protein analysis, genomics and proteomics analysis or molecular diagnostics.",1
23,The PCR is a three-step amplification process first introduced by Saiki and co-workers in .1985,1
24,This in-vitro enzyme-mediated method facilitates the generation of nucleic acid sequences based on the choice of specific primers.,3
25,During the first step—called denaturation—the hydrogen bonding stabilising the double stranded DNA template is broken to form two complementary single strands (see Fig. 1).,3
26,"In order to provide the energy necessary to break the bonding, this step is commonly performed at temperatures between 94 °C and 96 °C.",3
27,The temperature is then lowered for the annealing step: primers (synthetic sequences of single stranded DNA—normally 17–25 nucleotides long—which flank the target region to be amplified) specifically bind to the complementary sequences of the DNA template.,3
28,"At this stage, the temperature is primer-dependant and usually varies between 50 °C and 65 °C.",3
29,Finally the temperature is raised to allow extension: the template is typically replicated by a thermostable DNA polymerase.,3
30,"This temperature is often close to 72 °C, which is related to the temperature optimum of the DNA polymerase in conjunction with retaining hybridisation specificity of primers.",3
31,"The denaturation-annealing-extension cycle is repeated, typically between 25 and 40 times.",3
32,"Although these three steps are performed at three different temperatures, it is not uncommon to combine the annealing and the extension into one operation.",3
33,"Interestingly, at the end of the 1st cycle, the product obtained is defined only at one end, as the replication is a function of time at the extension temperature.",1
34,It is only at the end of the 2nd cycle that the specific product is first produced.,1
35,"Another interesting point is that two types of replication occur at the same time: semi-specific products such as those from cycle 1 lead to linear replication, whereas truly specific products or amplicons that are defined at both ends lead to exponential replication.",1
36,"Although the linear replication process is negligible in terms of amounts of DNA produced, it is a crucial intermediary step in PCR as it is through linear replication that a specific amplicon is obtained, thus rendering exponential amplification possible.",1
37,"Since 1985, different parameters for the PCR have been extensively studied to optimise the reaction and maximise amplification yield throughout a number of constraints imposed by different bioassays.",1
38,"The extraction of a thermostable enzyme, , from the bacterium  was the first breakthrough.",3
39,"Prior to this discovery, the enzyme was heat labile and lost its activity after each denaturation step.",3
40,"Consequently, the polymerase had to be replenished after each cycle which was arduous, but importantly increased the risks of contamination during PCR as the sample vial had to be re-opened, and made optimisation almost impossible to achieve.",3
41,The introduction of a thermostable enzyme obviated this cumbersome procedure and also enabled the automation of the process.,3
42,"Ensuing  polymerase engineering succeeded in enhancing processivity (which is defined for polymerases as the number of nucleotides added per unit to a strand during one sequence of binding and dissociation from the primer template) and fidelity (capability of a polymerase to faithfully replicate a DNA strand without expansion or deletion in the number of base pairs, nor substitution of the bases (AT ↔ CG)).",1
43,"In this study, a recombinant  polymerase-thioredoxin displayed an increase in processivity when compared to the wild-type  polymerase (from 50–80 nt to >300 nt).",1
44,"Other enzymes such as , KlenTaq, or  have been applied to PCR.",1
45,"Significantly, some enzymes are nowadays modified to block their activity until they are heat activated.",1
46,"This is for example the case of PfuUltra Hotstart DNA polymerase, which is commercialised by Stratagene.",1
47,"In this instance, heat labile antibodies neutralise the enzyme activity until they are denaturated during the initial PCR denaturation step.",1
48,"Such a procedure limits the formation of non-specific products, as it impairs the enzyme activity until thermocycling temperatures are reached.",1
49,"Priming methods comparing poly(A) tails and random hexamers for cDNA synthesis were studied by Resuehr and co-workers, while Halford  studied the effect of primer-dimer formation over the PCR yield.",1
50,Protocols to optimise PCR reactions are nowadays readily available.,1
51,PCR has also been studied from a more theoretical approach and statistical models describing the reaction are often based on the branching theory.,1
52,"Based on this theory, the number of molecules generated by a PCR reaction starting with a single molecule after n cycles is: (1 + p), where p is the probability for a molecule to duplicate.",1
53,Such an equation leads to two consequences.,1
54,"Firstly, the value p is positively linked to the PCR yield.",1
55,"Secondly, for large values of p, the distribution of the DNA population becomes multinodal, presenting multiple probability peaks.",1
56,This is due to the amplification during the initial cycle becoming critical and a failure for the original molecule to replicate having a lasting impact.,1
57,It is consequently essential to optimise the PCR parameters in order to obtain the most favourable conditions and enhance the PCR yield.,4
58,"Although PCR is the most popular DNA amplification technique, other methods also exist and are potentially suitable for microfluidic-based devices.",1
59,"For example, S (SSDA) is an isothermal technique first introduced by Walker  in .1992",3
60,"Comparably to PCR, this method allows exponential amplification of double-stranded DNA.",3
61,"The  (MSDA) technique is similar to SSDA, with the only difference being that during extension of the complementary strand, new annealing sites are generated for the first primer.",3
62,"Although MSDA can be applied with specific primers, it has also been used with random hexamers, leading to the amplification of entire genomes.",1
63,Such an amplification process produces tree-like molecules leading to amplified molecules of different lengths.,1
64,Indeed the generated strands are not cleaved from the strand molecule from which the amplification originated.,1
65,"A few products using this technique are commercially available, such as GenomiPhi DNA amplification offered by Amersham Biosciences, and REPLI-g from Molecular Staging.",3
66,Notomi  developed another method for DNA amplification:  (LAMP).,3
67,"This technique is based on MSDA but instead of using a set of two specific primers, or random hexamers, it involves 3 sets of specific primers.",3
68,Lizardi and co-workers used circularisable oligonucleotide priming to investigate amplification of circular DNA templates.,3
69,"This method, called  (RCA), produces a single-stranded product initialised by only one primer.",3
70,"Although this technique might seem limited as it only applies to circular templates with an appropriate promoter, a wider variety of applications are technically possible as circular templates include viruses and plasmids.",3
71,"RCA has been coupled to other techniques such as MSDA, or RCA itself ().",1
72,The  was initially introduced by Landefren  in 1988 and is based on the ability of two oligonucleotides to hybridise next to each other given an appropriate complementary DNA target molecule.,3
73,"Although this method was introduced as a single-base-modification detection method, it has since been used for the sole purpose of DNA replication.",3
74,The merging of PCR with gene micro-array applications has been demonstrated by  (SPA).,3
75,"In this method, the primers are surface-bound and thus do not freely diffuse in solution.",1
76,A Monte Carlo Lattice model was proposed by Mercier and co-workers to discribe solid phase amplification.,3
77,"As the amount of DNA generated is directly dependent on the number of primers immobilised at the surface, SPA would highly benefit from on-chip applications where area-to-volume ratios are greatly enhanced.",4
78,The application of PCR to define specific sequences for subsequent use as micro-array probes has also recently been described by Greiner .,3
79,"Although microfluidic devices were originally structured in silicon or glass, polymers such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), Poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) and Polycarbonate (PC) have increasingly been used as alternative substrate materials.",1
80,"The search for new substrate materials is still a burgeoning area, and many recent microfluidic devices for PCR have been fabricated using SU-8, PEEK, PTFE, Cyclic-Olefin-Copolymer (COC) or Zeonor (polymer commonly used for compact discs and DVDs).",1
81,"For a more detailed overview of some of the materials used, the reader should refer to references in Table 1.",1
82,The efficiency of biological reactions is often limited by interactions between the microchannel surfaces and the bio-molecules present in solution.,1
83,This issue is even more exacerbated by the wide variety of possible substrate material (see Table 1) in conjunction with the vast range of biological matter used as analyte; consequently various surface treatments have been investigated.,1
84,"One of the most widely used processes to prevent on-chip adsorption of molecules consists of silanisation, a method first introduced by Hjertén in .1985",3
85,"For example, El-Ali  performed a gas phase silanisation of a SU-8 chamber surface in order to enhance its PCR compatibility.",1
86,"Similarly, Shin and co-workers studied different silane compositions to decrease protein adsorption at glass surfaces.",1
87,"Noteworthy is that even though silanisation has been successfully applied to microfluidic devices, criticisms regarding the reproducibility of such coatings have been argued.",1
88,"To circumvent this issue, several methods have been investigated, and for instance, different strategies were implemented to prevent protein adsorption in PDMS microfluidic devices.",1
89,"Choi  favoured a mixture of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(acrylic), while Xiao and co-workers used a polyacrylamide gel.",1
90,"Alternatively, Shin and co-workers coated PDMS micro-channels with parylene in order to prevent adsorption on the chip surface.",1
91,An additional approach was introduced when Kirby  studied the effect of polarity and surface charge on cell adsorption by controllably modifying the zeta potential at the surface of their device.,1
92,"The following section addresses recent studies in the areas of cell culturing, cell identification and cell trapping, cell lysis and DNA extraction within microfluidic formats.",1
93,Much attention has focussed on the transfer of cell culturing techniques to planar chip formats.,1
94,"For example, Grodrian  applied the principle of segmented flow on chip for parallel cell culture by separating culture media plugs with immiscible fluid.",3
95,"Alternatively, Tan and co-workers recreated a tissue-like structure in a micro-fluidic environment using cell-matrix assemblies and biopolymers, while Schaak  have performed cell culture in droplets.",3
96,To assess the viability of the cultured cells Goto and co-workers implemented a protocol to detect nitric oxide released by macrophages.,3
97,Biological samples are most often present as a complex matrix.,1
98,It is therefore of paramount importance to be able to differentiate cells or targets of interest from other biological material.,1
99,"Different approaches have been implemented on chip, where for example, Lin  introduced an in-vitro impedance measurement of cells to distinguish between abnormal cells and normal cells under different frequency domains.",3
100,"Alternatively, Emmelkamp and co-workers chose an optical detection technique for sorting cells based on their intrinsic fluorescence signal within a microfluidic structure.",3
101,"After having detected the cell of interest, the next step is usually some form of isolation and concentration.",1
102,"To this extent, different techniques have been implemented on chip, such as dielectrophoresis (DEP).",3
103,Fuchs and co-workers have used DEP to trap individual particles among a few thousand cells suspended in a liquid on a microelectronic chip.,1
104,"Similarly, during a study of blood components and their inhibitory effects on PCR, Wolff and co-workers captured cells on electrodes by DEP while inhibitors were eluted by washing.",1
105,An alternative to conventional DEP has been proposed by Lapizco-Encinas  and involved electrodeless DEP for cell trapping.,3
106,Capillary electrophoresis was also used by Park  to demonstrate the capture and subsequent release of DNA fragments within PEEK tubing.,3
107,"Although DEP and electrophoresis are widely used techniques for cell trapping, other methods have also been investigated.",1
108,"For example, Denoual  presented a microfluidic device in which cells could be directed to cell traps by the fluid flow.",3
109,Lettieri and co-workers have also introduced a microfluidic device for performing controlled micro re-circulating flow capable of DNA trapping.,3
110,Two flows (an electroosmotic flow and a pressure-driven flow) were opposed and molecules were trapped by adjusting the different velocities.,3
111,"From another perspective Goubault  captured rare cells using magnetic filaments and adjusted the specific/non-specific discrimination ratio by optimising flow rates, while Lu and co-workers presented a rapid organelle separation by free flow isoelectric focusing.",3
112,"Electrophoresis has also been used to increase sample concentration, where Halle  introduced a micro-fluidic free-flow zone electrophoresis device to concentrate biological particles in buffer.",3
113,"In order to extract the different nucleic acid analytes from within a cell, controlled lysis is usually performed.",3
114,"Although regularly achieved by heating the cell, other lysis methods have been developed.",3
115,"For example, strong ultrasonic fields were applied by Tachibana , whereas Marmottant and co-workers presented an experiment during which gentle bubble oscillations were successfully applied to rupture lipid membranes.",3
116,Lu and co-workers also presented a miniaturised device for controlled cell lysis in order to release sub-cellular materials.,3
117,"Chemical lysis was performed by both Schilling , and Hong and co-workers.",3
118,"Once cell lysis has been performed, the issue of DNA extraction can be addressed.",1
119,"For example, Reddy and co-workers presented an organic-aqueous liquid extraction on a micro-device in order to purify DNA obtained directly from cells.",3
120,"On the other hand, Bienvenue  implemented a sol-gel technique to extract DNA.",3
121,Other groups have favoured more targeted approaches to isolate DNA from its medium.,1
122,"For example, Washizu and co-workers used electrostatic fields for direct DNA manipulations and Mohanty  applied dielectrophoresis and electrical impedance spectroscopy for single cell manipulation within microfluidic systems.",3
123,"Finally, Sundararjan and co-workers demonstrated immobilisation and programmable release of single DNA molecules by electrical heating.",3
124,"Since its introduction PCR sustains a tremendous impact in several fields, including clinical diagnostics, medical sciences and forensics.",1
125,However this technique presents several drawbacks.,1
126,"For example, the costs associated with each reaction are still quite high (mostly due to the price of the enzyme), even if current parallel processing has attenuated costs.",3
127,It is also well documented that PCR is highly prone to contamination due to its efficiency and high sensitivity.,3
128,"Additionally, a common advantage of miniaturised systems over macro apparatus is their reduced thermal mass: as they present less inertia to temperature changes ramping rates for heating or cooling are drastically increased, and this gives rise to more rapid gene amplification, and may present benefit for some of the conformation fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes used in real-time PCR.",3
129,"Whilst several of the more successful and reproducible applications of PCR are manifested in qualitative analyses, increasingly the requirements of PCR testing are placing a burden on elucidating a robust means to accurate and precise gene quantitation.",1
130,"For example, the definition of therapeutically significant disease thresholds could be used to more effectively treat infections or other diseases.",1
131,"Therefore the cumbersome processes that endure sample losses and sample degradation, ultimately compromise gene quantitation can be circumvented by employing closed μTAS.",3
132,A microfluidic approach to DNA amplification would present several advantages.,1
133,"Not only could system features easily be integrated to ease complex sample handling and tracking, but also possible risks of contamination would be reduced.",1
134,"Indeed several operations (such as sample preparation, PCR and DNA detection) could ultimately be integrated into one device.",1
135,"By rendering the system quasi-autonomous, interactions with the sample would be minimised and the number of possible sources of contamination would be greatly lessened.",1
136,These attractive features explain why the miniaturisation of the PCR apparatus has been of a growing interest in the scientific community.,1
137,The first on-chip PCR devices were presented by Northrup and co-workers in 1993 and Wilding  in .1994,3
138,Both devices consisted of a silicon chip with a micro-well in which the sample was loaded (see Fig. 2).,3
139,The entire chip was heated and cooled to provide the adequate thermocycling conditions.,3
140,"Since its introduction, this model has been replicated by numerous groups, sometimes with major amendments.",1
141,"These include integration of electrophoretic product sizing on a monolithic device, as well as optimisation of conditions to provide faster PCR (under 7 minutes), single-molecule detection, real-time applications and multiplexing.",3
142,"The use of micro-arrays and drop-metering provided these micro-devices with high throughput (more than 10,000 parallel reactions have been reported) and better fluid-handling capabilities, whereas thermocycling conditions, such as temperature uniformity and heat transfer optimisation, were closely studied.",3
143,A high versatility in terms of thermocycling conditions was shown by Kajiyama and co-workers when they presented independently-addressable wells.,1
144,"In addition, a variety of applications were successfully demonstrated, such as ligase chain reaction and isothermal nucleic acids amplification (NASBA).",1
145,There have only been few devices based on a well approach that differed significantly from the original design presented by Northrup.,1
146,"For example, Oda  addressed the invasive characteristics of heating elements conventionally used by replacing the heaters with a transparent contact-free heating technique based on infra-red wavelengths.",3
147,This device has since been developed further.,1
148,"Pal and co-workers performed PCR using induction heating, another non-contact heating method.",3
149,"In this paper the chips were mounted onto a ferrous ring, while the inductor was made of a copper wired wound around a ferrite core.",3
150,"By alternating the current going through the inductor, magnetic fields were produced.",3
151,"They then induced Eddy currents in the ferrous ring, which generated localised heat without any physical contact.",3
152,"In 2003, Krishnan  presented an original device relying on convection to provide thermocycling conditions.",3
153,"Two heaters sandwiched the Rayleigh-Bénard cell and were maintained at constant temperatures, namely 97 °C at the bottom and 61 °C at the top.",3
154,"Due to the difference in temperature, a convection flow developed in the cell, with an upward flux in the centre and downward fluxes on the sides.",3
155,"As the sample moved up and down in the cell, PCR conditions were provided and DNA was amplified.",3
156,This device was later modified by Wheeler and co-workers.,1
157,"It is to be noted that these devices are fairly flexible in terms of design: the well geometry can be tailored to a specific application, or arrays of wells are easily manufactured.",1
158,"However, they still do not take full advantage of lithographic techniques.",1
159,"For example, it would be difficult to implement efficient mixing structures.",1
160,"In addition, because the temperature of the entire chip needs to be altered for thermocycling, they display unnecessary inertia.",1
161,"A dynamic, moving-sample system particularly addresses previously described issues relating to full process integration.",1
162,"In the case of continuous-flow chips for example, transition times to change temperature depends only on the sample pumping rate and the time the sample needs to reach temperature equilibrium.",1
163,"Also heat inertia is reduced to a minimum because only the sample thermal mass needs to be taken into consideration rather than the chip plus sample as in the case of microwell PCR, with a direct consequence of enhanced rates of heating and cooling.",1
164,One approach to continuous flow-through based amplification was introduced in 1994 by Nakano and co-workers when they used capillary-based systems.,3
165,Their concept consisted of a capillary going through three different oil baths in a loop.,3
166,"The length of capillary in each bath determined the duration of the annealing, extension and denaturation steps.",3
167,The sample was continuously pumped through the capillary unidirectionally and DNA amplification occurred as the sample was going through each temperature cycle.,3
168,"Based on a comparable concept, Curcio and co-workers performed a high-throughput DNA analysis system in a Teflon tube by separating different sample plugs with immiscible organic plugs.",3
169,A similar experiment was performed in a capillary by Park,3
170,Friedman and co-workers proposed a static sample approach to nucleic acid amplification in .1998,3
171,"They enclosed the PCR sample inside a capillary, the ends of which were blocked by rubber pads.",3
172,"Each capillary was coated with a transparent Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) layer, ensuring that thermal cycling conditions could be independently controlled.",3
173,Finally Chiou  presented a bi-directional sample pumping system.,3
174,"In this device, the capillary was rested on three heating blocks and the sample was pumped back and forth to provide thermal cycling.",3
175,An optical system stopped the pumping mechanism when the sample reached the desired temperature zone.,3
176,The first continuous-flow PCR chip presented in 1998 by Kopp and co-workers provided the basis for subsequent developments.,3
177,It consisted of a serpentine channel that passed through three heating zones maintained at constant temperature by copper blocks (see Fig. 3).,3
178,"Remarkably, specifically amplified products were detected after 20 cycles in 1.5 minutes.",3
179,"Device improvements have included optimisation of the PCR conditions to prevent any cross-contamination during injection series, modification of the design to combine RNA Reverse-Transcription and PCR as well as a sensitivity study.",3
180,Applications such as high throughput and single molecule amplification and infectious biological agent monitoring have also been reported.,3
181,"Different approaches have been used to simulate the temperature distribution in continuous-flow PCR chips, such as finite element analysis, CFD-ACE+ (computational fluid dynamics and multi-physics software) and Lattice Boltzmann simulations.",3
182,Although the continuous-flow approach allows for fast heating and cooling rates (thus improving product specificity) parallelisation is not easily applicable as it would significantly complicate the design and most likely increase the footprint of the PCR chip.,3
183,"In addition, this type of device is restrictive in terms of number of cycles: the number of meanders is decided during the design procedure and cannot be modified to increase the number of cycles once the chip is manufactured.",3
184,"However, Liu  circumvented this drawback by manufacturing a rotary device, where a12nL-sample was introduced in the chip and subsequently pumped at a rate to enable 2–3 revolutions per minute.",3
185,Integrated heaters provided the temperature zones necessary for thermocycling.,3
186,Although the number of cycles could easily be adjusted (by changing the number of revolutions) the manufacturing process required additional and complex steps.,3
187,"Although the majority of microfluidic devices for PCR utilise batch or continuous-flow strategies, new approaches for DNA amplification have started to emerge.",1
188,"For example, an on-chip sample-shunting technique has been introduced by Auroux",3
189,"This approach, based on shunting the sample back and forth over heating zones in a straight channel by applying alternate pressure, combines the cycling flexibility of the well-chips with the quick temperature transition of the continuous-flow PCR micro-structure (see Fig. 4).",3
190,A theoretical evaluation of a system based on this concept was provided by Bu and co-workers.,1
191,A sample-shunting device using ferrofluidics for actuators has also been introduced by Hardt,3
192,"From another perspective, Pollack and co-workers used an electrowetting process to control droplets containing PCR reagents and demonstrated that such fluid handling did not inhibit DNA amplification.",3
193,A few approaches have also been developed on macro-scale apparatus and could also be of interest for microfluidic PCR.,1
194,"For example, high-speed PCR could be achieved on chip by using a microwave-assisted technique first demonstrated by Fermér",3
195,"DNA amplification in a water-in-oil emulsion, presented by Nakano , could be pushed to further limits thanks to the better fluid handling provided by micro-devices.",3
196,"In addition, since cells can be manipulated in a microfluidic environment (see section ‘Sample Preparation’), another application could be  (meaning inside a cell) DNA amplification.",3
197,"This technique, first introduced in 1990 by Haase , has since been optimised and has been combined to reverse transcription and to LAMP amplification, offering enhanced flexibility in terms of possible applications.",3
198,One of the main concerns when performing on-chip PCR is the loss in efficiency.,1
199,"Although this problem can be sometimes traced to inhibitory materials used during micro-device fabrication (, residual chromium from chrome masks in glass chip fabrication or thermocouples), the most predominant problem is the elevated adsorption of the PCR components onto the chip surface due to the increase of the surface-to-volume ratio in a micrometer-scale environment.",1
200,"For example, Erill and co-workers pinpointed that the component the most prone to adsorption was the  polymerase enzyme.",1
201,"Although surface coating strategies such as silanisation are possible solutions (see section ‘Surface treatment’), their effectiveness is sometimes questionable due to a lack of reproducibility.",1
202,"A second approach, called , includes passivating reagents directly in the PCR mixture.",1
203,The most common additives are polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA).,3
204,"Interestingly, Robinson  studied the influence of the molecular weight of PVP over the coating efficiency, as well as the effect of analytes in solution over BSA adsorption.",3
205,"Additional dynamic coatings have also been studied by Giordano  and include hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), epoxy (poly)dimethylacrylamide (EPDMA), and diaminobutane (DAB).",3
206,Cui and co-workers investigated the effect of single-walled carbon nanotubes on the PCR yield.,1
207,Results showed that the nanotubes increased the amount of DNA amplified when they were introduced in concentrations below 3 µg/µL.,1
208,"Finally, Yoon and co-workers examined the influence of pH, potential and electrode polarity in an electrowetting–based microdevice in order to prevent bio-molecule adsorption.",3
209,"Due to cost-effectiveness, the use of intercalators (molecules that upon binding to double-stranded DNA exhibit significant enhancements in their fluorescence quantum efficiencies) in combination with gel electrophoresis is probably the most widely used method in biological laboratories for the detection of post-PCR products.",3
210,"With this technique, the DNA molecules are effectively labelled with an intercalator dye and subsequently separated according to their sizes.",3
211,"Popular intercalating dyes include ethidium bromide and SYBR Green, but other intercalators have also been studied such as BEBO, YOYO and TO-PRO-.3",3
212,"The use of intercalators to detect DNA molecules presents two main advantages: it enables real-time detection and it is highly versatile, as the dyes have been selected to bind selectively to dsDNA.",3
213,"However, indiscriminate binding is also a major drawback: both specific and non-specific products will generate the same type of signal, making it difficult to differentiate between them.",3
214,Integrating a size separation method or denaturing gradient profile often assists the identification of authentic amplicons.,3
215,One of the most widely used on-chip detection techniques for DNA molecules is capillary electrophoresis (CE).,3
216,"CE was first demonstrated on chip by Manz . and has since then been applied in many fields, including the analysis of PCR products.",3
217,"Recent applications include the detection of short tandem repeats by Mitnik and co-workers, while Tseng  studied the effect of bubble cells on the resolution and the sensitivity of DNA separation during CE.",3
218,"Efforts to develop matrices for on-chip CE with lower viscosity comprised a novel sieving buffer based on hydroxypropylmethylcellulose presented by Han , as well as a study of a series of poly(ethylene oxide) matrices by Xu and co-workers.",3
219,A high-throughput device capable of genotyping simultaneously 384 samples in less than 325s was presented by Emrich,3
220,Other sequence-independent detection methods have also been investigated.,1
221,"For example, Messina  introduced a high-frequency sensor that enabled the differentiation between pre-amplification and post-PCR products.",3
222,Zangmeister and co-workers developed a novel fluorescence detection method based on the displacement of a fluorescent-tagged oligomer by the untagged target molecule.,3
223,"It is the authors' belief that, although real-time probes are not yet widely used for on-chip detection due to complex detection system requirements, they will soon be routinely implemented for on-chip quantitative and qualitative real-time PCR (RQ-PCR).",1
224,In this section the reader will find a brief overview of some of the commercially available real-time probes.,1
225,"The selectivity of real-time PCR was greatly improved with the introduction of fluorogenic probes (oligonucleotides whose sequences are complementary to part of the target molecules), such as the TaqMan or hydrolysis probes.",3
226,The detection principle is based on the quenching phenomenon known as Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).,3
227,"FRET corresponds to the transfer of energy from a fluorescent reporter molecule (R) to a quencher molecule (Q), leading to light emission by Q at a longer wavelength than the donor.",3
228,After hybridisation (and during annealing) the probe is cleaved due to the 5′ nuclease activity of the enzyme.,3
229,"As FRET is impaired, the reporter's emission can be detected.",3
230,"RQ-PCR optimisation using TaqMan probes has been performed and include the study of the best possible combinations between commonly used fluorophores and quenchers by Marras , as well as quantitative co-amplification of multiple targets (multiplexing) by Wang and co-workers.",3
231,"Based on a similar approach, Gilliland  introduced PCR quantitation by competitive PCR.",3
232,Duck  developed in 1990 the Cycling Probe Technology (CPT).,3
233,This detection method is based on a chimeric DNA-RNA-DNA probe labelled at one end with a reporter and at the other end with a quencher.,3
234,"Upon hybridisation with the target sequence, the enzyme RNaseH specifically cleaves the RNA region of the probe, resulting in fluorescence emission.",3
235,This method has been implemented on chip with success in Professor Harrisson's group.,3
236,A detection method similar to the CPB and also based on a hybridisation probe was recently released by BD Biosciences: the BD Qzyme Assay.,3
237,"The innovative component is the DNAzyme, a catalytically active oligonucleotide capable of cleaving nucleic acid substrates at specific locations.",3
238,"The DNAzyme operates in coordination with a DNAzyme-specific fluorogenic target that is cleaved during the PCR process, and consequently the fluorescent signal enables the real-time monitoring of DNA amplification.",3
239,"Since the introduction of the DNAzyme probes, several applications have been reported in the literature such as quantitation of nucleic acid sequences in real-time, study of the probe fluorescence signal and elaboration of a circular probe.",3
240,A new probe approach based on Minor Groove Binders (MGB) has recently been introduced by Epoch Biosciences.,3
241,MGB are flat molecules that can fit in the minor groove and interact with the phosphate-sugar backbone either by hydrogen bonds or by hydrophobic interactions.,3
242,"Such characteristics were proved to stabilise DNA hybridisation, resulting in shorter primers retaining higher melting temperatures and increased probe specificity.",3
243,Similar MGB technology is now used both by Applied Biosystems for their TaqMan chemistry and by Epoch Biosciences for their MGB Eclipse Probe Systems.,3
244,"MGBs are used in conjunction with fluorogenic probe technologies and are gaining in popularity with the increasing requirement to place probes over exact regions of target sequences, such as exon-exon boundaries used in splicosomic studies.",3
245,"Operating on a comparable FRET principle as TaqMan probes, Molecular Beacons were introduced by Tyagi and co-workers.",3
246,"They consist of single-stranded oligonucleotides arranged in a stem-loop structure, with a reporter probe attached to one of the stem arms and a quencher to the other.",3
247,"The loop portion is complementary to part of the target sequence, whereas the stem portion flanks the loop and are self complementary and unable to hybridise to any of the target sequence.",3
248,"To simplify, Molecular Meacons exist in two different states.",1
249,"When they are in a loop-stem structure, the fluorescence signal is quenched by FRET or proximity effects.",1
250,"On the contrary, during the annealing step, the loop part hybridises to the target molecule to separate the reporter and quencher dyes and a signal can be detected.",1
251,"Molecular Beacons have been used in a microfluidic environment to detect the breast cancer gene BRCA1 by Culha and co-workers, and also as a mean to study DNA hybridisation kinetics and to perform DNA melting temperature analysis by Dodge",3
252,"Based on a similar concept, Nazarenko and co-workers introduced self-quenched primers.",3
253,"These single-fluorophore labelled primers emit fluorescence with different intensities depending on their conformation: a weak emission is noticed when the primers are in a stem-loop configuration, whereas the fluorescence signal is at its maximum when the primers are incorporated in a double-stranded DNA helix.",3
254,Scorpion primers are an alternative to Molecular Beacons.,3
255,A Scorpion primer consists of a three-part molecule based on the following model: (PCR primer) – (blocker molecule) – (probe).,1
256,"During the PCR process, the primer hybridises to the target molecule and is then extended.",3
257,"Upon denaturation, the extended-DNA-strand/target hybrid is dissociated and so are the two arms of the Scorpion.",3
258,"Once the temperature reduced for the annealing/extension phase, the probe-part of the Scorpion anneals to the extended strand, the quenching process is impaired and fluorescence is detected.",3
259,Upon extension the probe is displaced and recovers its quenched conformation with a resultant drop in the fluorescence signal.,3
260,Roche Molecular Diagnostics have also developed a mutation analysis kit based on hybridisation probes.,3
261,"As with ligase chain detection, the probes are specifically designed to target the amplicon at adjacent sites.",1
262,"However, one probe is labeled at the 3′ end with fluorescein (the “donor” probe), whereas the two other probes are labeled with an acceptor dye on the 5′ end (either LC-Red 640 or LC-Red 705, each dye corresponding to a mutation possibility).",3
263,"The detection principle is based on FRET: the single-base-mutation is detected depending on the wavelength at which the signal is detected, as LC-Red 640 and LC-Red 705 emit at two different wavelengths.",3
264,The latest developments in DNA diagnostic technologies include the expansion of the DNA alphabet.,3
265,"EraGen Biosciences, Inc. developed the AEGIS (An Extended Genetic Information System) platform that extends the DNA alphabet by up to 8 new bases.",3
266,"Two of the new bases, isoC and isoG, have already been combined to the natural DNA bases to produce the company's diagnostic technology.",1
267,The GENE-CODE system is a real-time nucleic acid detection system based on the reduction in fluorescent signal during PCR.,3
268,"During the amplification process, a site-specific quencher is inserted opposite a complementary AEGIS base in one of the primers, resulting in signal diminution by FRET phenomenon.",3
269,This technology is still fairly new but clinical diagnostics assays based on the AEGIS bases isoC and isoG are already commercially available (such as the VERSANT HIV Assay developed by Bayer Diagnostics).,3
270,"Although real-time PCR methods using hydrolysis probes, conformation probes or hybridisation probes are powerful techniques, they are inherently limited in some cases, as pointed out by Gardner and co-workers regarding TaqMan probes.",3
271,"These probes are indeed highly specific, rendering the detection of viruses with substantial genetic variation among strains, such as the HIV virus, impractical.",3
272,"At the same time as the above techniques enabled quantitative PCR, the issue relating to data analysis became a paramount concern.",1
273,"Not only were systematic errors in fluorescence measurements investigated, but different methods of analysis were also introduced.",1
274,The most widely used procedure of analysis is the threshold method.,3
275,"Based on the background fluorescence signal, a certain level of fluorescence signal (usually around 10 times the value of the average background fluorescence value during early cycles) is imposed as the threshold limit.",3
276,"After plotting the fluorescence signal obtained during PCR against the number of cycles performed, the intersection of this curve with the threshold limit can be determined.",3
277,"It is often called the threshold value, or C value, and represents the number of cycles necessary to generate an exact amount of DNA.",3
278,"With this method, C values can be compared and DNA template concentrations can be calculated.",3
279,"Although this method is well accepted among the scientific community, new approaches have been proposed.",1
280,"For example, Rutledge and co-workers studied the mathematics of quantitative PCR and offered an alternative analysis tool based on DNA mass at threshold limit, whereas Liu  favoured the kinetic curves to extrapolate the initial amount of gene transcript.",3
281,New algorithms have also been developed to promote automatic analysis of real-time PCR data.,3
282,"Whilst quantitative PCR assays present a significant challenge for microfluidic applications, the development of qualitative assays such as the analysis of genetic mutations has attracted much attention.",1
283,"Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are frequent non-random base substitutions, present at 1 per 1000 base pairs within the genome, and are avidly studied for association with diseases.",3
284,Several techniques to detect SNPs have been implemented on chip.,3
285,"For example, Kimbal and co-workers applied Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TGGE) in a polycarbonate micro-device.",3
286,Buch  combined standard gel electrophoresis to TGGE in their 2-D separation device.,3
287,"In the first dimension, molecules were separated by gel electrophoresis according to their sizes, while TGGE allowed a SNP analysis in subsequent perpendicular channels.",3
288,"Using hydroxy-ethylcellulose as a sieving matrix, Liu and co-workers used TGCE and successfully separated a mixture of wild type DNA, mutant type DNA and the corresponding heteroduplexes.",3
289,Ito  favoured Affinity Capillary Electrophoresis (ACE) to develop a gene mutation assay.,3
290,"Zhong and co-workers performed SNP genotyping by applying a combination of allele-specific oligonucleotides attached to the chip surface, detector probes and a thermostable DNA ligase.",3
291,Another approach was presented by Russom : they analysed SNPs by extending allele-specific fluorescently labelled nucleotides.,3
292,DNA hybridisation is widely exploited to achieve high selectivity and sensitivity.,1
293,Different approaches have been applied on chip.,1
294,"For example, Lai and co-workers developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on a compact disk platform, while Cai  determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy that DNA hybridisation is strongly frequency-dependent.",3
295,Trau and co-workers applied PCR reactors combined to microarrays to genotype Chinese medicine plants.,3
296,"Magnetic beads were also used in microfluidics devices to immobilise by hybridisation alternatively the target template, the capture probe or various sensing agents.",3
297,A different approach was introduced by McKendry : using cantilever assays they were able to determine the sequences of unlabeled DNA molecules present at nanomolar concentrations.,3
298,One of the main challenges in miniaturisation is the integration of functional components to perform several operations without the need for macro apparatus or manual user input.,1
299,A few groups have started to tackle this issue and a brief overview of the integrated systems available at the moment is given in this section.,9
300,A number of instances of integrated on-capillary systems have been recently presented in the literature.,1
301,"For example, Li and co-workers developed a system that could perform cell counting, cell-lysis, PCR, on-column hybridisation and product detection.",3
302,"In addition, an integrated on-capillary arrangement capable of cell-lysis, reverse transcription PCR and product analysis was reported by Matsunaga , while a set-up capable of PCR, sequencing and purification in capillaries was introduced by Hashimoto",3
303,Several examples of on-chip integrated systems have also been published in the literature.,1
304,One of the devices combining the most operations was presented by Liu,1
305,"Their device enabled the following steps: cell capture, cell concentration, cell lysis, purification, PCR, SNP assaying and hybridisation.",3
306,"In addition, valves, mixers and pumps were incorporated onto the chip.",3
307,"Another system offering various capabilities—namely cell capture, cell lysis, purification and DNA amplification—was introduced by El-Ali and co-workers.",3
308,"Other structures have also been investigated, and for a more detailed overview of some of the most recent, the reader should refer to Table 2.",8
309,"As can be seen in this table, the pre-PCR steps that are integrated the most include cell capture, cell lysis and sample purification.",1
310,The well-approach PCR seems to be favored for integrated systems when compared to the continuous-flow process.,1
311,This might be due to an increased simplicity in sample handling for the former method.,4
312,The physical elements the most integrated are heaters and valves.,1
313,DNA amplification is mostly performed to increase the detection sensitivity either of a specific molecule among a heterogeneous population or to characterise and/or measure a given section of a target.,1
314,"However, even though the merits of PCR are widely recognised, the process of DNA amplification impairs the speed, the cost-effectiveness and even sometimes the accuracy and the sensitivity of such detection methods.",1
315,"To resolve this issue, U.S.",3
316,Genomics has developed a unique method with which single molecules from an un-amplified sample can be detected using the GeneEngine.,3
317,"This system relies on isolating the target from the sample, fluorescently tagging it and finally injecting it into the test platform where each molecule is subsequently detected by laser illumination.",3
318,"Using DirectMolecular Analysis, quantitation, SNP analysis and molecule interaction quantification can be performed by colour coincidence counting.",3
319,Analysis in less than one minute and femtomolar range sensitivity are claimed to be achieved.,3
320,"Alternatively, DirectLinear Analysis enables the sequencing of single linear genomic DNA molecules.",3
321,Sequence-specific probes are first hybridised to the DNA molecule.,3
322,The strand is then stretched and the probes are detected linearly by the GeneEngine.,3
323,"A spatially resolved map of specific sequence locations on the DNA can then be generated, leading to a ‘genetic barcode’ for each individual molecules.",3
324,"Applications of such barcodes include genetic comparison of samples or populations, SNP detection and genome mapping or microorganisms.",1
325,"The future of high throughput gene analysis will benefit greatly from the implementation of micro Total Analysis Systems, particularly for the analyses requiring multi-step procedures such as those including sample preparation.",1
326,"Microfluidic devices will serve therefore to provide a level of standardisation not presently achievable with current laboratory standard operating procedures, especially those based upon minute quantities of samples.",1
327,"As the development of microfluidic devices continues, newly devised microstructures need to utilise the better production and micro-engineering procedures.",1
328,"Importantly however, the devices should also innately incorporate the requirements of each bioassay to enable them to be customised to the exact requirements of the specific bioassay and thus permit the optimum co-selection of device and choice of assay chemistry.",1
0,Pressure dependence of the reaction H + O (+Ar) → HO (+Ar) in the range 1–900 bar and 300–700 K,9
1,"The reaction H + O (+Ar) → HO (+Ar) was studied in a high pressure flow cell in the bath gas argon at pressures between 1 and 900 bar and temperatures between 300 and 700 K. H atoms were generated by laser flash photolysis of NH at 193.3 nm, HO radicals were monitored by light absorption at 230 nm.",9
2,The results are consistent with experimental low pressure rate constants  = [Ar] 2.5 × 10(/300 K) cm molecule s and theoretical high pressure rate constants  = 9.5 × 10(/300 K) cm molecule s from the literature.,5
3,"The intermediate falloff curve was found to be best represented by / = [/(1 + )] with  = /,  ≈ 0.3,  ≈ 1.05, Δ ≈ 0.1 (+Δ for ( + log ) < 0 and −Δ for ( + log ) > 0), and (Ar) ≈ 0.5 independent of the temperature.",5
4,A comparison with literature data between 300 and 1200 K does not confirm major deviations from third order kinetics in earlier medium pressure experiments.,4
5,It is well known that the chain-terminating reaction H + O (+M) → HO (+M) is of central importance in the oxidation of hydrogen-containing molecules.,1
6,Its rate at low pressures has been measured repeatedly since about 1945 and the uncertainty of the third order low pressure rate constant  today is estimated to be about ±25%.,1
7,Investigations of a transition to the high pressure range of the reaction have been made only rarely.,2
8,In experiments at 300 K up to pressures of 200 bar of the bath gas Ar the pseudo-second order rate constant  was found to fall about a factor of 10 below the extrapolated .,1
9,Studies of the H–O–NO reaction in Ar between 800 and 900 K and at pressures of 1–14 bar could not detect substantial deviations from third order.,1
10,More recent shock tube measurements at Ar-pressures up to 110 bar and temperatures around 1300 K realized marked deviations from the third order low pressure limit.,3
11,"These experiments, however, were disputed on the basis of statistical adiabatic channel/classical trajectory (SACM/CT) predictions of the high pressure rate constant  combined with calculations of ([M]) in the falloff range of the reaction.",1
12,The pressure dependence of the reaction may appear to be of only limited interest for normal combustion since deviations from third order occur only at comparably high pressures.,1
13,"However, because of the large importance of the reaction in combustion, even modest deviations may become relevant when precise rate constants are required.",2
14,This is particularly true when the bath gas is a very efficient collider such as water.,1
15,There is considerable interest in the high pressure properties of the reaction in the field of supercritical water oxidation where temperatures are of the order of 800–1000 K and water pressures are around 250 bar.,1
16,"In order to decide the above mentioned dispute and to provide data for the construction of precise high temperature falloff curves, we have designed a new high pressure flow cell and investigated the reaction at pressures of the bath gas argon up to 900 bar and over the temperature range 300–700 K. These experiments now allow us to characterize the pressure dependence of the reaction up to temperatures such as they are of interest for combustion and supercritical water oxidation applications.",0
17,Our high pressure flow cell was made from highly heat resistent stainless steel (Inconel alloy 718 from Special Metals Co.).,10
18,The internal diameter of the cylindrical cell was 22 mm and its optical pathlength was 100 mm.,10
19,The cell was closed with quartz windows of 20 mm thickness at both ends.,10
20,Reaction mixtures were slowly flowing through the cell in such a way that the complete volume was exchanged between individual runs of the experiments.,10
21,"The cell could be heated up to 900 K at pressures up to 1000 bar, the temperatures in the cell were controlled by thermocouples.",10
22,The reaction mixtures were preheated before flowing through the cell; gas temperatures in the cell were found to be constant within about 2%.,10
23,"Reaction mixtures consisting of 10–1% of O, 0.1–100 ppm of NH and the bath gas Ar (99.9999%) were prepared in storage vessels and compressed by an oil-free membrane compressor.",10
24,H atoms were produced by laser flash photolysis of NH using an ArF excimer laser at 193 nm.,10
25,HO radicals were monitored by light absorption at 230 nm using a high pressure Hg–Xe arc lamp as light source.,10
26,Typically about 1000 runs were averaged.,10
27,"Rise times of the HO signals of the order of 1 μs and decay times of the order of 15 μs were observed, see Fig. 1.",8
28,The rise of the HO signal was almost entirely dominated by the reaction H + O → HO and it was only marginally influenced by secondary reactions which were modelled by a complete mechanism such as characterized by the data given in .,5
29,The HO profile of Fig. 1 documents the quality of the signal and demonstrates the different time scales of the rise of the HO concentration and its decrease due to loss processes.,5
30,The pseudo-first-order rate constants for HO formation were strictly proportional to the concentration of O.,5
31,"More details of our experimental technique, the modelled mechanism and results for other bath gases such as helium and nitrogen will be described in a later publication.",1
32,At this stage we only report the results obtained in argon because a comparison with the high pressure measurements from  can be made for this bath gas.,1
33,"Without tabulating the individual measured points in this communication, Fig. 2 summarizes our results in a doubly reduced falloff plot. / is shown as a function of /, employing the recommended experimental low pressure rate constant  = [Ar]2.5 × 10(/300 K) cm molecule sfrom the evaluation in , and the theoretical high pressure rate constant  = 9.5 × 10(/300 K) cm molecule sfrom .",8
34,The latter was calculated with an  potential energy surface of HO and employing an SACM/CT approach.,1
35,The results of this treatment in  were compared with calculations made on the DMBE IV potential energy surface and the expression for  given in eqn. (3) was confirmed.,5
36,Fig. 2 indicates that a common reduced falloff plot can represent all data from 300 to 700 K. We found that the conventional symmetric falloff expression with  = / and  ≈ 0.75 − log  did only provide a fair fit of the data from Fig. 2.,5
37,Instead an asymmetric falloff expressionproduced better agreement with the data and with the modelled falloff curves.,8
38,"This fit is included in Fig. 2 with the parameters  ≈ 0.3,  ≈ 0.75 − log  ≈ 1.05, Δ ≈ 0.1 (+Δ for ( + log ) < 0 and −Δ for ( + log ) > 0).",5
39,The center broadening factor (Ar) ≈ 0.5 as well as the parameters  and Δ were found to be essentially independent of the temperature.,5
40,"Eqns. (2), (3), and (5) serve for the construction of full sets of falloff curves such as shown in Fig. 3.",6
41,"The agreement between the present results and the given expression, of course, is the result of fixing the fit parameters.",8
42,One realizes that the experiments from  correspond practically to the low pressure limit.,5
43,"The experiments from , on the other hand, are found to be somewhat further into the transition range between  and .",1
44,"However, in agreement with the conclusions from , one finds that the highest points from  for some unknown technical reason are probably too low.",8
45,One has to realize that the precision of the shock wave experiments was not good enough to provide precise information on the shape of the falloff curve such as this was possible in the present work.,5
46,"Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that complications, which were not considered in the theoretical modelling of , at high temperatures lead to additional broadenings of the falloff curves.",1
47,"Such complications, , may arise from nonstatistical lifetime distributions of HO* such as suggested for HO* in .",4
48,"However, unless such effects are clearly proven to exist, the falloff curves derived in the present work should be used in all practical applications.",4
49,The present experiments have provided strong experimental support for the previously modelled falloff curves of reaction (1) over wide ranges of temperatures and pressures.,4
50,"After accounting for different values of  in different bath gases, eqns. (2), (3), and (5) will provide an adequate basis for representing  in the fields of high pressure combustion and supercritical water oxidation.",4
0,Measurements of molecular fragment alignment and orientation in the UV photodissociation of NO and O,9
1,REMPI-TOF studies of the UV photodissociation of NO and O at 320 nm and 270 nm respectively have allowed both the orientation and alignment parameters of the molecular photofragments to be determined.,9
2,"The orientation parameter, 20(21), for the NO(XΠ,  = 0) fragment is found to be essentially the same for the three quantum states,  = 29, 30 and 40 with a value of 0.24 ± 0.04 (2σ), as probed  (1 + 1′) REMPI, on the AΣ ( = 0) ← XΠ ( = 0) transition.The O (a Δ = 0  = 20) fragment shows a markedly larger orientation parameter, for example 20(21) = 0.55 ± 0.04, measured on the S(20) transition.",5
3,These orientation parameters and the accompanying alignment parameters which describe the fragments' angular momentum polarisation have been used to confirm spectral assignments within the highly perturbed (2 + 1) d Π( = 2) ←← a Δ ( = 0) REMPI spectrum of O.,0
4,"Angular momentum polarisation of both atomic and molecular photofragments is a direct consequence of the nature of the potential energy surface upon which the bond cleavage occurs, and experimental studies of photodissociation have increasingly focused on measuring the distributions of photofragment angular momentum vectors  relative to other vector quantities such as the fragment relative velocity and the parent transition moment.",1
5,"These distributions of angular momentum are characterised by a set of moments, (), averaged over the photofragment ensemble, and can be divided into two classes, namely those corresponding to the  and to the  of  (those of even and odd rank  respectively).",1
6,"The former can be probed with linearly polarised light, and have been the subject of many investigations into the alignment of product angular momentum with respect to a reference axis.",3
7,"An example is in the moment 00(22) which relates the products' velocity  and angular momentum  and is equal to the expectation value of the second order Legendre polynomial, 〈(cos)〉, where  is the angle between the vectors.",1
8,"However, such measurements give us no insight into the sense of this angular momentum.",3
9,"For example, they may inform us that a molecular photofragment is rotating in the -plane with its velocity related to that plane, say in the positive  direction, but we cannot tell if the angular momentum vector is pointing in the positive or negative  direction: we can measure alignment but not orientation.",1
10,The use of circularly polarised light overcomes this difficulty and allows orientation parameters to be measured.,3
11,"Such experiments on the orientation of molecular fragments are far less numerous than their alignment counterparts, yet the information they yield is essential for a full understanding of the state or states involved in the photodissociation.",1
12,"In the work presented here we first employ both linearly and circularly polarised light to probe,  (1 + 1′) resonance enhanced multiphoton ionisation (REMPI), the NO photofragment from NO photolysis at 320 nm.",9
13,"We demonstrate the applicability of time of flight (TOF) spectrometry to extract alignment and orientation parameters on this test system, and compare our orientation results with those previously obtained by Brouard . using laser induced fluorescence (LIF), and Nesterov and Cline using ion imaging.",0
14,"Secondly, we apply the same method to measure alignment and orientation parameters for the O(a Δ = 0  = 20) fragment from the 270 nm photolysis of ozone.",9
15,"We use several (2 + 1) REMPI transitions which involve excitation of the two photon d Π( = 2) ←← a Δ ( = 0) transition, and show that by measurement of both alignment and orientation we can confirm the assignments in the highly perturbed rotationally resolved spectrum: spectroscopy through dynamics.",5
16,"For the photolysis of NO, pulsed radiation at 320 nm was provided by the frequency doubled output of a Nd:YAG pumped tuneable dye laser [Spectra Physics GCR-200 + LAS LDL 2051], while the counter-propagating pulsed probe radiation around 225 nm was from the frequency doubled output of a XeCl excimer pumped dye laser [Lambda Physik EMG 101 MSC + Lambda Physik FL2002], exciting individual rotational lines of the NO A Σ ( = 0) ← XΠ ( = 0) band.",10
17,"The beams were focussed to overlap in the source region of a modified Wiley McLaren TOF mass-spectrometer, into which a room temperature sample of NO, at a backing pressure of around 120 Torr, was injected  a pulsed valve.",10
18,The rotational temperature of the molecular beam was measured to be 150 ± 10 K from the REMPI spectrum of NO expanded through the nozzle under the same conditions.,10
19,The laser pulses were overlapped temporally as well as spatially to allow a (1 + 1′) REMPI detection scheme whereby both the photolysis and ionising radiation were provided by the 320 nm wavelength light.,10
20,"The probe light at 226 nm was kept at low intensities to avoid saturation of the strong one-photon resonant transition, and the absence of saturation was confirmed by the invariance of the TOF profiles with laser intensity.",10
21,"For the studies on ozone the excimer pumped system was used as the 270 nm photolysis laser, with the YAG pumped system providing the photons near 320 nm for the (2 + 1) REMPI of the O a Δ ( = 0) product.",10
22,Ozone was introduced through the pulsed valve into the mass spectrometer from a room temperature bulb containing approximately 100 Torr of a 1∶1 mixture of ozone and O.,10
23,The space-focussed ions were detected by the TOF system following the REMPI pulse as previously described.,10
24,The alignment moments were extracted using linearly polarised pump and probe sources.,10
25,"The polarisation of one laser was fixed with its electric vector at a predetermined angle to the TOF axis, using a polarizing crystal.",10
26,"The counter-propagating second laser beam was switched between two values of this angle, , normally 0 and 90° using a photoelastic modulator [Hinds Instruments Inc. PEM-90].",10
27,"The extraction of the orientation parameters required a circularly polarised probe beam, which was again provided by the photoelastic modulator.",10
28,"Here the helicity of the probe beam was switched, with the electric vector of the photolysis beam held at 45° to the TOF axis.",10
29,"Weak single-laser signals were subtracted from the two-laser signal, and all profiles were power normalised by monitoring the intensity of back reflections of the uv light.",10
30,"For extraction of the alignment moments, the average of around 1000 time of flight profiles per geometry was found to give a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.",8
31,For the photolysis of NO the comparatively small differences between the profiles generated with switched left and right circularly polarised light meant that averages of around 15 000 profiles were required for experiments to determine the orientation moment.,8
32,The greater effect on the time of flight profile of the orientation parameter in a (2 + 1) REMPI process compared to that for a (1 + 1′) scheme meant that it was unnecessary to average more than 2000 profiles to extract moments in the ozone experiments.,4
33,"The intensity and shape of the time of flight profile depends upon both geometric parameters (such as the photolysis and probe lasers' polarisations relative to the time of flight axis and the spectroscopic transition being used) and dynamical parameters (the distributions of the vectors , the parent molecule transition moment, , the fragments' relative velocity and , the diatomic angular momentum).",6
34,"The profile may be described by the expression: where  are functions of geometric parameters (relative directions of the laser beams and TOF axis), line strength factors (we refer to the latter as ) and moments, (), () are  order Legendre polynomials, and the variable  = /, where  is the projection of the fragment velocity along the TOF axis, and  its speed.",6
35,The index  takes values that are determined by the polarisations of the pump and probe lasers and the number of photons used in the REMPI process.,6
36,"The line strength factors, , are calculated using the formalism derived by Kummel, Sitz and Zare (KSZ).",6
37,"The values that we seek are (), the moments of the distribution, ie the ensemble averaged values of the distributions of the vector quantities.",6
38,"The most important of the bipolar moments of even rank are 00(22), 20(20) and 20(02), describing the –, – and – pair correlations respectively, and these can be found by analysing the TOF lineshapes taken with judicious choices of angles of the electric vectors of the linearly polarised photolysis and REMPI lasers relative to the TOF axis.",1
39,"There are also higher order moments which affect the shape of the time of flight profile, such as 20(22) which represents the triple vector correlation between ,  and , and their extraction and significance is discussed later.",1
40,Maximum sensitivity to the orientation moment is obtained by photolysing with linearly polarised light at an angle of 45° to the TOF axis and taking the difference between TOF profiles with left and right circularly polarised probe radiation.,8
41,"We give explicitly our expression for Δ(), the difference between left and right circularly polarised signals as a function of the parameter :Δ() can be quantitatively related to the distribution of ion arrival times, our experimental observations.",6
42,"We note that Δ() is for the difference of  arrival times: in practice we find that the time integrated left and right circularly polarised signals are equal to within experimental error (4%), giving confidence in the successful operation of the photoelastic modulator.",8
43,Our expression for Δ() derived from the KSZ formalism is identical to that derived by Cline,6
44,"In particular we are able to obtain the orientation moment 20(21), which describes the preferred sense of rotation of the diatomic fragment and is defined as 20(21) = −2〈sin  cos  sin  sin 〉 where (,) and (,) are the polar angles which define the photofragment velocity and angular momentum vectors respectively in the body fixed frame.",6
45,In this frame the fragment recoil velocity lies in the  plane and the  axis is parallel to the transition dipole moment .,6
46,"Thus, in the case where  and  are less than 90°, a positive value for 20(21) indicates that fragments' angular momentum is oriented preferentially along the − direction.",6
47,"Again higher order odd rank moments appear in eqn. (2), and we discuss their influence later.",8
48,"First, we present data on the nascent NO fragment from the photodissociation of NO at 320 nm recorded using (1 + 1′) REMPI  the A state of NO.",9
49,Although our emphasis is on the orientation of the NO fragment we discuss first the alignment parameters obtained for photolysis at 320 nm with the linearly polarised probe beam tuned to the P + Q( = 40) transition in the A Σ ( = 0) ← X Π ( = 0) band.,9
50,Table 1 shows the results.,8
51,"For prompt dissociation of a non-rotating and non-vibrating NO molecule, where the transition moment  for the B–A band lies in the molecular plane parallel to the line joining the two oxygen atoms, we would expect  to be perpendicular to both  and ,  the correlations with  to be close to their perpendicular limits, and this is seen to be the case in Table 1.",5
52,If the ground state geometry of NO is preserved in the promptly dissociating excited state we expect the – correlation 20(20) = 0.88.,7
53,"Many previous studies have measured 20(20), and have shown that its value is reduced from this limit for the rotating molecule, and depends upon fragment speed (and thus dissociation wavelength).",1
54,"In LIF experiments probing NO ( = 0,  = 29) from a thermal sample of NO Brouard . found 20(20) = 0.61 ± 0.02 at a photolysis wavelength of 308 nm, whilst earlier experiments by Baker  in this group reported 20(20) = 0.26 ± 0.14 for photolysis at 355 nm, where the fragment speed is approximately halved.",1
55,"Baker  also measured the NO ( = 0,  = 15) fragment and found that 20(20) increased to 0.41 ± 0.06, reflecting the greater energy available for product translation.",1
56,"When the same  = 15 line was probed in photolysis of a jet cooled (10 K) NO sample, 20(20) increased to 0.61 ± 0.15, the same value as that reported by Hradil  in ion imaging experiments carried out on a 15 K sample.",1
57,"These authors noted that their result, the average over several rotational states, was substantially larger than values previously measured for samples close to room temperature.",1
58,The present value of 0.64 ± 0.03 for  = 40 at a photolysis wavelength of 320 nm and a sample temperature of 150 K is consistent with previous observations.,5
59,There are fewer previous measurements of other pair correlations.,1
60,"Our value of 00(22) = −0.42 ± 0.06 is in keeping with previously published results which show  and  to be dominantly perpendicular The value of 20(02) = −0.30 ± 0.05 is within experimental error the same as that of Brouard  (−0.23 ± 0.02) for the same line at 308 nm, but as we would again expect the – correlation to be dependent upon fragment translational energy and parent internal energy, the agreement may be fortuitously dependent upon the cancelling of these two effects in the two studies (room temperature sample, 308 nm photolysis and probing  = 29 at room temperature compared with 320 nm photolysis and probing  = 40 at 150 K for the present data).",5
61,We finally note the higher moments in Table 1.,8
62,"20(22), the triple vector correlation, was found simultaneously with 00(22)from the sum and difference of profiles taken with magic angle photolysis and switching the 226 nm beam between  = 0 and 90°.",10
63,"For the 20(42) term (which describes a higher order correlation between ,  and ), profiles were analysed with the photolysis laser polarised parallel to the TOF axis and with  = 0 and 90°: these show an increased sensitivity to this moment.",10
64,"The results are consistent with the pair correlation values of Table 1 and these, together with the pair correlations discussed above serve to give confidence in the analysis procedures employed in these TOF studies.",8
65,We now describe the results of experiments with circularly polarised probe radiation to determine the orientation moment 20(21).,9
66,"Three lines were chosen for study, namely the P + Q( = 40) line discussed above, together with the R + Q ( = 30) and P ( = 29) features.",9
67,"In Figs 1a and 1b we show the sum and difference profiles for left and right circularly polarised 226 nm probe radiation for the R + Q ( = 30) and P ( = 29) lines, with the 320 nm photolysis laser polarisation at 45° to the TOF axis.",8
68,"Sums and differences are shown to give an idea of the magnitude of the difference between the signals with the two circular polarisations, of the order of 5% at the line centres.",8
69,"The best fits to the difference profiles are shown, and yield 20(21) = 0.26 ± 0.04 and 0.22 ± 0.04 for  = 30 and 29 respectively.",5
70,For the P + Q( = 40) transition we find 20(21) = 0.25 ± 0.04.,5
71,"We note that in this (1 + 1′) REMPI process the difference profiles are expected to be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign for R and P branches, and this is observed in Fig. 1a and 1b.",5
72,"Q branches are insensitive to the fragment helicity at these high values of , and hence the contribution of the Q and Q sub-bands to the  = 30 and  = 40 lines does not affect the difference profiles providing the R or P branch contribution is appropriately normalised.",1
73,"The difference profiles should be zero for the geometries where the photolysis beam electric vector is at 0° or 90° to the TOF axis, and an example confirming this is shown in Fig. 1c for the P + Q ( = 40) transition and  = 90°.",8
74,"The contributions of the higher order 20(23) and 20(43)terms to the difference profile were neglected in our analysis, as the value of  in eqn. (2) is zero for a (1 + 1′) REMPI process when the ionisation efficiency is assumed to be independent of fragment alignment.",1
75,"We find the 20(21) moment to be insensitive to the three quantum states probed, with a state averaged value of 0.24 ± 0.04.",5
76,"This is in excellent agreement with the results of ion imaging studies by Nesterov . at 355 nm in which the NO sample was cooled in a molecular beam, (20(21) = 0.2 for levels probed with the P ( = 36) and R ( = 21) lines) and with the LIF studies by Brouard  at 308 nm which employed a room temperature sample and measured 20(21) = 0.22 ± 0.04 for the same P ( = 29) transition as measured here.",1
77,"It appears that the orientation is little affected by parent angular momentum, as the three studies used markedly different NO rotational temperatures.",4
78,"We note that in the work by Cline the A state of NO was ionised using a third colour whereas in this work, we use the photolysis laser to ionise NO from the intermediate A state.",1
79,"Saturation of the first excitation step would lead to an apparently reduced magnitude of the moments measured, but the good agreement between our values of 20(21) and the alignment moments compared with those of previous work again suggests that we avoid saturation.",5
80,"The results are qualitatively in accord with the expectation that the impulse given by the departing O atom acts on the N end of NO, causing rotation with  pointing in the  direction.",4
81,"Having established the consistency of the results obtained from our experimental method with those measured previously, we now turn to the photolysis of ozone.",9
82,"At a photolysis wavelength of 270 nm the dominant dissociation channel produces O in the low lying first excited state, a Δ, and Fig. 2 shows a section of the (2 + 1) d Π( = 2) ←← a Δ ( = 0) REMPI spectrum of nascent O around 320 nm, with assignments from the recent analysis of Morrill",8
83,"The d Π( = 2) upper level is perturbed by curve crossings with the nearby II Π valence state, and this results in a highly irregular band structure, with branches split into a number of spectrally distinct sections.",1
84,"The S and R branches shown in Fig. 2 however have  values around 20 which are highly populated in the photolysis of ozone at 270 nm, and the lines in the nascent spectrum are not markedly overlapped by other transitions.",5
85,Photodissociation at 270 nm in the Hartley band proceeds by two spin allowed routes forming O(a Δ) + O(D) and O(X Σ) + O(P) in the ratio 0.9∶0.1 respectively.,1
86,The curve crossing on the excited state potential that leads to formation of the X Σ state of O is allowed only for odd J states.,1
87,"This results in a selective depletion of species with odd J in the rotational distribution of the O(a Δ) product, a result first demonstrated in the CARS experiments of Valentini and co-workers.",1
88,"Although populations are difficult to extract from the highly perturbed REMPI spectra, the data of Fig. 2 do show an intensity alternation, with depletion of the intensities of lines with odd J. For example, in Fig. 2 the intensity of the S(19) line is considerably below that of the neighbouring S(20) and S(18) lines, whereas for a REMPI spectrum taken under conditions where the population alternation is absent (for example, Fig. 6 of ) the S(19) intensity is higher than those of its neighbours.",5
89,A similar effect is seen in the R and in the (more congested) O branch of Fig. 2.,8
90,We focus first on the two (2 + 1) REMPI transitions shown in Fig. 2 at the probe laser wavelengths of 320.499 nm and 320.821 nm.,10
91,Our wavelength scale for the transitions is in accord with the energies given by Morrill . to within the precision of our laser wavelength step size (0.002 nm).,10
92,The lines have been assigned as S(20) and R(20) transitions respectively and we again show first the results of experiments with linearly polarised photolysis and probe beams.,5
93,"Table 2 collects data for the two transitions taken (as for NO) with appropriate combinations of photolysis and probe polarisations, and shows good agreement amongst the values of the alignment moments for the two probe transitions.",8
94,"The constancy of such data confirms the assignments of Morrill . for these two lines, and we illustrate this confirmation in the analysis of data in Figs. 3a and 3b.",4
95,"Here we see the effect of switching the polarisation of the REMPI laser from  = 0 to 90°, whilst holding the photolysis laser at the magic angle of 54.7° to the TOF flight axis.",9
96,"This experimental geometry is sensitive mainly to the bipolar moment 00(22),  the – correlation.",9
97,"We see that the difference profiles are of opposite sign in the two cases, exactly as expected for S and R branch transitions, with a smaller difference for the R branch as expected from the relative values of the line strength factors .",8
98,"Probing on an S branch transition will therefore yield a higher sensitivity to the – correlation moment 00(22), as seen in the slightly lower error limit of Table 2.",4
99,"Fits to the data with the assumption that the lines are identified as S(20) and R(20) respectively return a common and physically reasonable value of  −0.26 for the 00(22) bipolar moment, indicating the velocity and angular momentum of the diatomic photofragment are dominantly perpendicular (although not as marked as in the case of NO).",5
100,The higher order terms listed in Table 2 were obtained in a similar way to that described for NO photolysis.,8
101,In addition however it was necessary to involve moments () with the index  = 4.,6
102,"These moments have a particularly marked effect on the R branch transition of a (2 + 1) REMPI process, as reflected in the flatter profile near  = 0 in Fig. 3b compared with the shape of the S branch in Fig. 3a, and their values were consistent with the lower order moments shown in Table 2.",5
103,"If we neglect the moments with  = 4, we find for example values of 00(22) = −0.16 ± 0.2 and −0.21 ± 0.08 for the R(20) and S(20) lines respectively, and a comparison of these values with the data of Table 2 indicates the large effect for the R branch, together with a change in the error limits for the less affected S branch.",5
104,"We also note that the widths of the profiles are consistent with these assignments: the width depends upon the translational energy release in the photolysis, and its value gives an estimate of the O internal energy.",8
105,"The resultant energy resolution for these data at  = 20 can be estimated as corresponding to Δ = ±3, by no means of high spectroscopic quality, but useful again for confirmation of the assignment.",5
106,"The other alignment moments in Table 2 for  = 20 are consistent with a parallel transition followed by prompt dissociation, as for NO.",8
107,"Our reported values for the – correlation, 20(20), are in broad agreement with previously published data on the molecular fragment from photofragment translational spectroscopy (0.8 ± 0.1, 275 − 295 nm) and time-of-flight studies within this group (0.65 ± 0.07 at 290 nm) and on the atomic fragment  photofragment spectroscopy (0.50 ± 0.05, 274 nm), VUV LIF (0.56 ± 0.06, 266 nm) and ion imaging (0.75 ± 0.08, 265 nm; 0.80 ± 0.08, 275 nm).",1
108,The variation in magnitude of 20(20) within these studies can again be attributed to varying rotational temperatures of the parent O molecule.,4
109,"Qualitative indications of perpendicular alignment of  and  vectors in the Hartley band dissociation of ozone have been reported in our previous TOF measurements, and in the ion imaging experiments by Suits",3
110,"In Table 2 we also include measurements on the O(24) line at 321.810 nm, which also appears to be isolated in Fig. 2 (we are unable to study O(20) because of spectral congestion).",8
111,Once again the analysis as an O branch line yields similar alignment parameters to those for the S and R branch lines.,8
112,"Measurements of these vector correlations at different wavelengths in the Hartley band, as a function of , and on transitions in the (1,0) as well as the (2,0) d Π ←← a Δ band will be described elsewhere: in this work we concentrate only on even values of  for photolysis at 270 nm.",1
113,We now turn our attention to the orientation parameter 20(21).,1
114,"Fig. 4 shows measurements on the S(20) and R(20) features of Fig. 2, again with the electric vector of the photolysis laser at 45° to the TOF axis and with circularly polarised probe radiation.",8
115,"Differences between profiles taken with left and right circularly polarised light should now show the same sign for S and R branches (the dominant  term in eqn. (2) is the same sign for the two branches), as experimentally observed, and in contrast to the linearly polarised example shown in Fig. 3.",5
116,We also note the magnitude of the difference is considerably larger than for the NO case of Fig. 1.,8
117,"Although part of this is because of a larger value of 20(21) (see below), we note that the orientation effect is much more easily observed using a (2 + 1) REMPI scheme, as the geometric factors, , for probing the orientation moment 20(21) are considerably greater than for (1 + 1′) REMPI.",4
118,"Lineshapes observed with linearly polarised light allows straightforward differentiation between branches with different values of |Δ|,  the S and R branches shown in Fig. 3.",8
119,With linearly polarised light however it is not straightforward to distinguish between O and S branch transitions as the sensitivity to branches with |Δ| = 2 is the same.,8
120,"They may be differentiated when circular polarisation is employed, as shown in Fig. 4c.",8
121,"Here we measure correlations on the O(24) transition at 321.810 nm and observe a change in sign of the difference profiles compared with the S branch, confirming the assignment of Morrill",5
122,"Although the present measurements are on lines where the assignments are robust, we suggest that the use of this “spectroscopy through dynamics” method of determining the magnitude and sign of Δ and also the magnitude of  (within rather wide error bars) will be useful in the assignment of the more perturbed and overlapped regions of the spectrum.",4
123,"For example, on the strong feature at 321.451 nm in Fig. 2, noted as a P branch head, we measure a value of 00(22) = −0.07 ± 0.07 when it is analysed as a pure P branch transition, a result which is incompatible with the values of  −0.27 obtained earlier.",5
124,"Part of this discrepancy may be explained by overlap with O branch features at this wavelength, as the two branches in linear polarisation will have difference spectra which have opposite signs.",4
125,"We now consider the values of the 20(21) bipolar moment, and turn first to the S(20) transition.",9
126,"The ratio / in eqn. (2) is 4.5, which in combination with the premultiplier factors means that the effect of the higher moment terms is negligible (for example, the coefficient of 20(23) is only 6% of that for 20(21)).",5
127,Extraction of 20(21) for this and similarly for the O(24) line is therefore straightforward and yields values of 0.55 ± 0.04 and 0.60 ± 0.04 respectively.,5
128,"For the R(20) line the magnitude of the coefficient of 20(23) is now 30% of that for 20(21), and we should not neglect higher terms.",5
129,"However we find that our returned values of 20(21) are relatively insensitive to the absolute magnitudes the two higher terms in eqn. (2), because their coefficients are of opposite sign and their effects tend to cancel.",8
130,"For example, if we set 20(21) equal to 0.57, the average value found from the S and O branch measurements, and vary both 20(23) and 20(43) in fitting the sum and difference profiles of the R branch line we find values of −0.32 and +0.80 respectively.",5
131,"If we neglect the higher moments we obtain a value of 20(21) = 0.65 ± 0.02, close to our value when higher moments are taken into account, and illustrating the cancelling effect.",5
132,"We should note however that although we are insensitive to the absolute values of these higher moments, we are sensitive to their ratio.",4
133,"In the limiting case when  and  are perpendicular to , then we can express20(23)/20(43) = −√15/8 = −0.48, and this is close to our observed ratio of −0.40.",5
134,We see good agreement with the values of the orientation moment 20(21) for the three branches.,8
135,"Our value for the S(20) line, 0.55, is approximately twice those observed from the photolysis of NO but of the same sign, indicating again the dominance of the recoil effect on the central atom in determining the sense of the product rotation.",5
136,"The magnitude of the impulse delivered by the departing O atom is approximately the same for the photolysis of both parent molecules, with the departing NO and O fragments both having speeds of approximately 1000 ms.",5
137,The difference in 20(21) values remains to be explained in terms of the appropriate angles described in eqn. 3 and we hope that measurements such as these will stimulate trajectory calculations on the latest  surfaces.,4
138,"Photolysis of a thermal sample of NO at 320 nm produces NO(X Π) fragments whose average orientation parameter, 20(21), is 0.24 ± 0.04.",5
139,The orientation parameter is found to be essentially independent of the quantum state probed and our results are in excellent agreement with complementary investigations.,5
140,Studies on the O (a Δ) fragment produced from photolysis of O at 270 nm show that this fragment is also oriented but now the orientation is markedly larger with 20(21) ≈ 0.6.,5
141,We have been able to make use of angular momentum polarisation to confirm spectral assignments of the highly perturbed O d Π( = 2) ←← a Δ ( = 0) REMPI spectrum.,4
0,"The anomeric effect in 1,3-benzodioxole: additional evidence from the rotational, vibration–rotation and rovibronic spectra",9
1,"The millimetre wave pure rotation and vibration–rotation spectrum of 1,3-benzodioxole has been studied and the vibrational spacing between the two lowest vibrational states in the five membered ring puckering potential has been determined with considerable accuracy, at Δ = 259 726.035(10) MHz or 8.663 5280(4) cm.",5
2,"In addition, rotationally resolved analysis of two hot bands near the reported origin band in the laser-induced fluorescence spectrum has been carried out and was found to rule out the current literature assignment of this spectrum.",5
3,"The new information has been used to reassign the lowest vibrational transitions in the far-infrared and the Raman spectrum of 1,3-benzodioxole in terms of a one dimensional potential with a central barrier of 108 cm, which successfully accounts for all states up to  = 5, and for the observed variation in rotational constants.",5
4,"Considerable reassignment of the published spectra, as well as new experimental work is still necessary for a confident determination of the low-energy region of the molecular potential of 1,3-benzodioxole.",1
5,Determination of the effects which are responsible for the preferred structural conformations of molecules is often less than straightforward.,1
6,"It is useful to keep in mind that the understanding of such a basic feature, as the staggered geometry of ethane, has come only recently, from a careful computational study showing that this geometry results from hyperconjugation and not from steric repulsion.",1
7,In cases of molecules which have conformers of comparable energy separated by small energy barriers the situation is often much more complex.,1
8,"Even the geometry at the global minimum, and not only its origin may be uncertain.",1
9,"Several spectroscopic studies of 1,3-benzodioxole (BDO) have been carried out, and were devoted to elucidation of details of its large amplitude motion, which is a convolution of ring puckering, flapping and ring twisting.",1
10,"The molecule is shown in Fig. 1, where the parameters used to describe the ring puckering and flapping motions are also indicated.",1
11,Earlier investigations led to conflicting conclusions.,2
12,"The results of a far infrared (FIR) investigation were interpreted in terms of planarity of the molecule, whereas a single vibronic level fluorescence (SVLF) study suggested that the molecule is non-planar, with the barrier to planarity attributed to a twisting motion at the oxygen atoms in positions 1 and 3.",3
13,"The pure rotational spectra of the ground state and of several, mainly ring puckering, vibrational satellites, also indicated unambiguously that the molecule is non-planar, but that the barrier to planarity is due to the puckering motion of the five membered ring.",3
14,"The puckered conformation of BDO has been interpreted to originate from the anomeric effect, which is a stereoelectronic effect that involves the donation of electron density from a lone pair on one oxygen atom to the adjacent carbon-oxygen bond.",1
15,"Such interaction, believed to be the result of n–s* overlap, reaches its maximum value when the –C–O–C–O torsional angle is at 90° and is excluded in case of a planar ring.",1
16,"Since the puckering of the ring increases the magnitude of the anomeric effect, there can be a stabilization of a nonplanar structure.",1
17,The studies reported in  combined the analysis of far-infrared and Raman spectra with that of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) from electronic transitions between the ground (S) and the first excited electronic (S) states.,3
18,"In  a partial reassignment was made of the fundamental transition of the butterfly motion, with respect to  and  while in  the potential energy surface of the ring puckering and butterfly motions was determined for the first time in the S state.",1
19,"Following the experimental results, two theoretical studies confirmed the anomeric effect to be the main effect in determining the bent conformation of BDO in both S and S states.",1
20,"We will use throughout the text the notation ,  and  to label the vibrational states of ring-puckering, flapping (or butterfly) and twisting motions, respectively.",6
21,"In normal mode numbering the pertinent quantum numbers are ,  and , respectively.",6
22,"The electronic transitions will be labelled using the notation 10, where  labels the normal mode,  is the vibrational quantum number for this mode in S, and  is the corresponding value in S.",6
23,"Analysis using a 2D model comprising of ring-puckering and butterfly motions, was performed in  although some unusually large discrepancies between the observed and the calculated transition frequencies were obtained.",3
24,"Since rotationally resolved techniques allow for unambiguous identification of vibrational states, some of us measured the rotationally resolved spectrum of several strong, mainly cold bands of the LIF spectrum of the S ← S (π* ← π) electronic transition of BDO.",3
25,"It was found that, for S, the rotational constants of state  = 2 obtained from the 3920 and 3921 transitions as assigned in , were incompatible with each other.",1
26,"A new assignment of the ring-puckering states in S, needed to understand the molecular geometry and the anomeric effect, is still missing.",2
27,"In order to succeed in the reassignment, we need to be sure of the assignment in S.",2
28,"Since the  = 1–0 (Δ) splitting has not been measured experimentally, but deduced from the centrifugal distortion effects, this was the primary target of additional measurements.",0
29,"At the same time we searched for the rotationally resolved spectrum of the 3911 transition, measuring some weak hot bands close to the band at 34 783.53 cm, so far attributed to the origin.",0
30,"BDO (99% purity) was purchased from Aldrich, and was used without any further purification.",10
31,"The millimetre wave spectra were recorded in Warsaw, and the rovibronic spectra in Florence, as described below.",3
32,"We used the broadband millimetre wave spectrometer based on backward wave oscillator (BWO) sources, which has been described in  and references cited therein.",3
33,"The spectrometer uses source modulation, and the frequency of the source is locked to the controlling 3 GHz synthesizer by means of two phase lock loops.",3
34,"The millimetre wave spectrum was recorded at frequencies from 170 to 279 GHz, by means of two different mm-wave sources.",10
35,"Measurements were made on a static sample kept at room-temperature and pressure of 20–50 mTorr, which was held in a 3 m long absorption cell of 10 cm diameter.",10
36,"The fluorescence excitation spectra were recorded using the experimental apparatus in Florence, described in detail elsewhere.",3
37,"The sample was introduced directly into the molecular beam source and was heated to 50 °C, to reach a suitable concentration of BDO in the molecular beam, while the 50 μm-diameter nozzle was maintained at a slightly higher temperature (55 °C) to avoid condensation and clogging of the nozzle.",10
38,"The carrier gas was pure helium at a pressure of 6 × 10 Pa for the cold bands, and 8 × 10 Pa for the hot bands.",10
39,"The molecular beam was obtained by selecting the central part of the expansion with a 400 μm-diameter skimmer, placed at 10 mm from the nozzle.",10
40,"On passing through the skimmer the molecular beam entered a second, differentially pumped, chamber in which it could interact with the UV radiation and where the LIF signal was collected.",10
41,The excitation source was a ring dye laser (Coherent 699-21) with Rhodamine 6G as lasing medium pumped by an argon ion laser.,10
42,"The ring laser was operating in single mode, and was actively frequency stabilized.",10
43,"To obtain the UV radiation the frequency of the ring laser was doubled using an external cavity (Wavetrain, LAS), and we obtained up to 20 mW of UV power, at the crossing point with the molecular beam.",10
44,The UV linewidth was 3 MHz.,10
45,"The fluorescence radiation was collected by a system of two spherical mirrors and two lenses, and it was focused on the photocathode of a photomultiplier tube (EMI 9893Q/350).",10
46,The photomultiplier tube signal was then sent to a photon counter (SRS 400).,10
47,"The frequency scan of the laser was monitored by a 150 MHz free spectral range étalon (to check the regularity of the scan and to control that the laser does not jump from the selected cavity mode), and by a wavelength-meter (Burleigh Wavemeter) to check the absolute calibration.",10
48,The accuracy of the laser wavelength measurement is of 0.04 cm in the UV.,10
49,The data acquisition and the laser scan were controlled by a personal computer.,3
50,"Upon realising from measurement of bands displaced from 94 to 383 cm from the origin band that the assignment of  was in question, we considered it crucial to assign the 3911 transition, expected to lie close to the origin band.",2
51,"This would have supplied the Δ splitting in S, to compare with the value of Δ in S.",1
52,"We found, in the proximity of the origin at 34 785.53 cm, two candidate hot bands, one displaced by −14.5 cm, and a second one by +1.5 cm (Fig. 2).",8
53,"The results of fitting the measured frequencies for these two bands, using a rigid rotor Hamiltonian and the program Jb95, are given in Table 1.",8
54,The measured and the obs. − calc. frequencies are listed in supplementary Tables S1 and S2. The rotational constants of the lower states for the two new bands are compared in Table 2 with those for the lowest excited vibrational states of S known from the microwave investigation.,8
55,It can be seen that the  and  constants differ by close to ten times the experimental errors from the values in the S = 1 state.,8
56,"Neither of the two new transitions appears to originate from that state, so none of these bands can be satisfactorily assigned to the 3911 transition on the basis of rotational constants.",5
57,"In addition assignment of the lower frequency band to 3911 would require a considerable difference between the Δ values in S and S, and a much larger Δ spacing in the S state (by at least 15 cm) than the reported value of 8.1–8.3 cm.",5
58,"On the other hand assignment of the +1.5 cm band would require the 3921 band to be within about 8.2 + 1.5 = 9.7 cm of the 3920 band, whereas candidate bands according to the assignment of  and the measurements in  are 7.53(11) cm apart.",5
59,"If we compare the S rotational constants obtained from the two new bands with the values for the lowest lying vibrational satellites in S obtained from the pure rotational spectrum, we can see that they most closely match those of  = 2 and of the combination state ( = 2,  = 1).",5
60,A correspondence with  = 1 also cannot be excluded.,5
61,"For any of these to be the case the 000 band, the origin, would actually have to be at a considerably lower value, by  300 cm, than the reported frequency.",4
62,We have indeed seen some indications of the presence of very weak bands in that region.,8
63,"The inconsistencies discussed above provide further evidence, in addition to that already reported in  that the assignment of the ring puckering progression in S, as given in  is most probably incorrect.",4
64,"It appears that the key 39 band, and even the actual band origin are still to be identified.",4
65,"Since the value Δ = 8.4 cm in the S state was not an experimental one, but was derived from experimental centrifugal distortion constants we made an attempt to measure it directly, with millimetre/submillimetre wave spectroscopy.",9
66,The results are given in the following section.,1
67,"The measurements of the pure rotational spectrum in the ground,  = 0, and in the first excited ring puckering state,  = 1, were first extended to the millimetre wave region by using predictions based on the rotational constants of .",3
68,"The spectrum is relatively weak, since BDO has a small dipole moment equal to 0.237(5) D and 0.222(4) D in the ground, and in the first excited state, respectively.",5
69,"The dipole moment is in the form of the  dipole moment component, so that only -type rotational transitions would be expected.",7
70,"Since the asymmetry of the molecule is appreciable, with the asymmetry parameter  = −0.643 for the ground state, the spectrum was expected to be devoid of many of the characteristic features that normally serve to aid the assignment.",7
71,"Nevertheless, as the molecule is close to planarity it gives rise to the type-II bandheads, which are characteristic of high- transitions in such molecules.",1
72,"The bandheads are produced by specific overlaps of R-type transitions with differing values of  and , such that  decreases and  increases by 1 away from the leading line in the band.",1
73,"Such bands were indeed observed for both states, as visible in the specimen spectrum reproduced in Fig. 3, and their measurement allowed for rapid expansion of the pure rotational data set.",8
74,An attempt to fit such data demonstrated that it was no longer viable to carry out single state fits as was possible with the less extensive data sets of .,5
75,"In the present case it was necessary to carry out simultaneous fits of data for  = 0 and  = 1, by taking account of the high order, Coriolis-type interaction connecting such states.",3
76,"We used the block diagonal Hamiltonian of the form = Δ +  +  + ,where  and  are single state Watson’s asymmetric rotor terms in representation I and reduction",6
77,"The interstate coupling term  has been expressed in the reduced axis system Hamiltonian suggested by Pickett = ( +  + )( + ),which is equivalent to a second order Coriolis coupling term.",6
78,The empirical centrifugal distortion expansion of the  coupling constant proved to be necessary for fitting vibration–rotation transitions.,5
79,The measured frequencies were fitted using Pickett’s SPFIT program.,3
80,"Pure rotational R-type transitions were measured for  = 0 and  = 1 states at frequencies up to 210 GHz, which are near the maximum of the rotational absorption profile, see Fig. 4.",10
81,The values of rotational quantum numbers ranged up to  = 90 and  = 40.,5
82,"The pure rotational data set by itself already allowed the Δ vibrational energy level spacing to be determined to within several tens of MHz, at which point location of vibration–rotation transitions became feasible.",5
83,"Since the dipole moment change induced by the puckering vibration will be perpendicular to the ring plane and along the -inertial axis, the vibration–rotation transitions are expected to follow -type selection rules.",7
84,Their initial prediction was made by assuming that the associated vibrational dipole moment was at least comparable in magnitude to the permanent dipole moment.,6
85,"The calculated intensity profiles are shown in Fig. 4 and take the form of a considerably distorted P, Q, R structure.",8
86,"The compact Q branch at 260–270 GHz was thought to offer the best chance for observation, while the comparably intense R branch was outside the frequency range of the available spectrometer.",5
87,"The prediction proved to be sufficiently accurate to readily locate the Q-branch interstate transitions, which were indeed found to be considerably more intense than the pure rotational transitions, see Fig. 5.",5
88,"The vibrational transition moment proved to be sufficiently high to observe also the P-type interstate transitions, some of which are marked in Fig. 3.",5
89,"We assigned and measured a total of 181  = 1 ← 0 transitions and fitted them together with pure rotational transitions in  = 0 and  = 1 states, also using the SPFIT program.",3
90,"The resulting spectroscopic constants are reported in Table 3, and the measured transition frequencies and obs. − calc. differences are collected in Table S3 of the ESI. The vibrational spacing has been determined with a very high accuracy, Δ = 259 726.035(10) MHz, that is 8.663 5280(4) cm.",5
91,Part of the reason for this accuracy is the low level of intercorrelations affecting Δ.,5
92,"It is interesting to compare relatively small values of the Δ constants in Table 3 with 0.644(10) and −0.575(11) kHz determined, respectively for  = 0 and  = 1 states in single state fits.",8
93,"This provides direct evidence for the level of effective centrifugal distortion contributions introduced by the inversion potential, which was the basis for the derivation of additional information on the potential carried out in .",5
94,"For the first time, we have a precise experimental value for the ground state ring puckering splitting in S, whereas in previous analyses this could only be determined indirectly.",1
95,The present value of 8.663 5280(4) cm is found to be intermediate between previous estimates.,8
96,"Two values, 8.1 and 8.31 cm were determined from potentials fitted to observables from pure rotation spectra and far-infrared data of .",1
97,"A value of 9.6 cm was also inferred upon reinvestigation of the far-infrared spectrum, and was found to be consistent with the potential fitted therein to far-infrared, Raman, and fluorescence spectra.",1
98,"Until now assignment of transitions involving higher quanta was considered reliable, such as that of  = 2 ← 0, for which values of 99.1 and 100 cm were derived from far-infrared and dispersed fluorescence spectra, respectively.",2
99,In view of the uncertainty concerning the reliability of the assignment we decided to re-examine the available data by going back to the simple one-dimensional analysis.,0
100,"An isolated ring-puckering mode would be expected to be well described by a double minimum potential, as has been the case for 1,3-dioxole.",1
101,"An economic form of such a potential, such as the reduced quartic–quadratic() = ( + ),is defined by only two parameters, and central barrier to planarity, , is simply given by /4.",1
102,"Even in the presence also of other low-frequency normal modes this type of 1D-potential section should provide a sufficiently accurate description, at least in the energy region below excitation of other modes.",1
103,Since there is a consensus between theory and experiment that both the twisting and the flapping modes are well above 200 cm in frequency there should be several puckering energy levels in the intermolecular potential below the first excited states of the twisting or flapping motions.,7
104,"In addition the several operable (and for practical purposes mutually exclusive) selection rules, Δ = 1,3 in the far-infrared, and Δ = 2,4 in Raman are expected to generate quite a sizable number of observable transitions between only the several lowest vibrational states.",7
105,"We used the program ANHARM from the PROSPE web-site for these calculations, together with the new Δ and vibrational frequencies from .",3
106,We decided to retrace the assignment from scratch and the results are collected in Table 4.,8
107,"For a double minimum potential the compression of the first two vibrational states by the presence of the central barrier at the planar configuration is accompanied by a somewhat smaller compression of the next higher pair of states, which leads to the second lowest vibrational frequency.",5
108,It was immediately found that for the  estimate  = 150(50) cm for BDO the use of the current value of Δ leaves only the 58.2 cm line in the infrared spectrum as the only realistic candidate for  = 3 ← 2.,5
109,This is in fact the assignment of .,1
110,The use of these two lines to predict the  = 2 ← 1 transition leads to a frequency of 76 cm.,5
111,"The most probable assignment is therefore the nearest line to high frequency, at 79.5 cm, since there is no candidate to low frequency.",4
112,"In fact the 58.2 cm line is rather broad and structured, so it is better to use 8.66 and 79.5 cm transitions to define the potential, whereupon we immediately find that the 148.2 cm line can be assigned to  = 3 ← 0.",5
113,"The only other transition involving quanta up to  = 3, namely  = 3 ← 1 is indeed also found in a consistent position in the Raman spectrum, at 138.5 cm.",5
114,"We have thus satisfactorily assigned all transitions up to  = 3, and we note that the agreement for = 3 ← 2 would be improved if the mean frequency of its broad profile and not the low frequency peak were used.",5
115,"Nevertheless assignment of transitions involving the  = 4 level meets difficulties, while there are plausible candidates for transitions to the  = 5 level, but not involving  = 4.",8
116,We note that the calculated energy of 231 cm for  = 4 is close to the estimated positions  = 1 and of  =.1,5
117,There could therefore be several mechanisms by which the position of this level could be perturbed.,1
118,"If we assume a small 6 cm upward shift in the position of  = 4 then it becomes possible to assign five more vibrational transitions, as seen in Table 4.",6
119,"It is noted that all of the assigned transitions are consistent with those with the selection rule Δ = 1,3 being observable in the infrared, and those for Δ = 2,4 being observable in Raman, and that relative intensities are in fair agreement with the calculated ones.",5
120,A further test of the derived 1D potential was carried out by checking its ability to reproduce a second reliable piece of experimental data namely changes of rotational constants and inertial planar moments with  measured in .,9
121,"For this purpose we used a different form of the double minimum potential() = [1 − (/)],where  is the barrier to inversion and  is the equilibrium value of the inversion angle (see Fig. 1).",6
122,"This potential was augmented with a flexible model, available for one and two-dimensional motions, and the molecular framework was constructed by using the parameters listed in .",6
123,"Vibrational energies in Table 4 were reproduced with  = 108.5(11) cm,  = 22.50(6)° and the changes in rotational constants and second moments of inertia required two additional adjustable parameters describing the variation in the CCO valence angle  with puckering excitation() =  + Δ().The results of this calculation are compared with experimental values in Table 5.",6
124,It should be noted that observation of the zigzag behaviour in rotational constants in the range  = 1–3 is indicative straightaway that these levels are in the vicinity of the central barrier.,8
125,"In the derived 1D potential  = 0 and 1 are 50 and 41 cm below the barrier, respectively, while  = 2 is 38 cm above the barrier.",8
126,Reproduction of the planar moments and rotational constants as documented in Table 5 is seen to be excellent.,8
127,"The  rotational constant is a possible exception, but its behaviour is known to be the most difficult to reproduce, since it is associated with the smallest moment of inertia.",5
128,The barrier of 108 cm corresponding to the present 1D assignment is somewhat lower than analogous 1D values of 124 cm () and 128 cm.,8
129,"It is also lower than barrier heights of 126 cm, and 164 cm, derived on application of a more sophisticated two-dimensional model.",8
130,"We have, in fact, also sought a 2D model solution that would encompass the 1D solution described above.",1
131,"We have found that the density of lines in the spectra is such that if the criterion for reproducing frequencies is reduced to, say, 3 cm, and the relative intensity criteria are also relaxed, then it is not possible to achieve a unique fit.",5
132,The number of parameters in the 2D-fit and their flexibility is such that they are able to equally successfully encompass many radically different assignments of transitions.,5
133,A confident assignment of the  = 1 ← 0 transition would be the minimum requirement for an attempt at a more reliable analysis with that model.,4
134,On the other hand observation of the  = 2 ← 0 transition in the Raman spectrum near 88 cm would be enough to confirm the present 1D analysis.,4
135,"The present work has delivered several new, precise pieces of information pertaining to the molecular dependence of the chemically relevant anomeric effect.",1
136,"Augmentation of the available lower resolution data by information from rotationally resolved spectroscopy revealed considerable deficiencies in previously published spectral analysis, suggesting that a considerable re-assignment of the ring puckering transitions in 1,3-benzodioxole is required for both the S and the S states.",4
137,"The origin of the S ← S electronic transition almost certainly has to be re-assigned, it is expected to lie at a lower frequency than that reported in  and further work on this problem is in progress in the Florence laboratory.",4
138,"It is now clear that, while there is little doubt that the puckering barrier in 1,3-benzodioxole is considerably lower than the value of 275 cm in 1,3-dioxole, its precise elucidation is proving rather difficult, as evidenced by the number of previous reports devoted to this problem.",4
139,"While a full 2D analysis of the dynamics of the five-membered ring would be more appropriate, it is mandatory to first reach a confident assignment of several more states, in particular those with  > 0.",4
140,On the other hand the success of the 1D analysis suggests that near the minimum of the potential the dynamics is dominated by the puckering.,4
141,It is also worth noting how close the actual value of Δ = 8.663 5280(4) cm turned out to be to the value of 8.31 cm calculated on previous application of the 1D model to all data from pure rotational spectroscopy.,5
0,Studying reaction kinetics by simultaneous FRET and cross-correlation analysis in a miniaturized continuous flow reactor,9
1,In this study we present a refined optical detection technique for investigation of fast reactions based on confocal fluorescence spectroscopy in a miniaturized continuous flow (μCF) reactor.,3
2,The special setup allows for simultaneous observation of the reaction on the basis of fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) as an indicator of the reaction progress.,3
3,"Determination of the flow velocity  spatial fluorescence cross-correlation enables the conversion of spatial information,  the position of the detection point, into the respective temporal information.",3
4,"To overcome the disadvantage of conventional continuous flow reactors of high sample consumption, we used a microfluidic chip allowing an economical expenditure of sample solution at low concentration, while the silicon/glass chip is perfectly adaptable to the confocal setup.",3
5,"Inside these channels, rapid, diffusion-based mixing under laminar flow conditions is performed at the crossing of three channels by squeezing the solutions into thin layers.",1
6,"Using this μCF device, we investigated the irreversible cleavage reaction of a double stranded DNA oligomer by the enzyme exonuclease III.",9
7,"The complementary DNA strands are stained with TAMRA and Cy 5 dye molecules, respectively, undergoing an energy transfer if both strands are annealed.",10
8,The reduction of the Cy 5 fluorescence directly corresponds to the progress of the cleavage reaction.,5
9,Time-resolved kinetic studies of chemical and biochemical processes provide essential information for a detailed understanding of molecular interaction and reaction mechanisms.,3
10,"However, many of these reactions occur on very short time scales that render an appropriate time resolution particularly hard for conventional techniques of data collection.",3
11,"Thus, a wide variety of techniques have been proposed in the past and developed for the initiating and probing of fast reactions in the time scale of microseconds and below, such as relaxation techniques for reversible reactions induced by temperature or pressure jumps, or flash photolysis for light-induced reactions.",3
12,"Many biological reactions,  enzymatic catalysis, are induced by mixing and collision of two (or more) reactants.",1
13,"For the observation of fluid-based reactions in general, continuous and stopped flow methods were introduced quite early on  and since then have been constantly improved with respect to temporal resolution from a few seconds down to the submicrosecond regime.",3
14,"The beauty of the continuous flow kinetics is the concept of transforming the temporal information into a spatial one, supporting the simultaneous observation of a system at different time points by spatially resolved detection.",3
15,"In spite of their conceptual elegance, continuous flow experiments usually suffer from the practical drawback that large amounts of sample solution are consumed during the experiment, which has in the past limited their applications.",3
16,"However, in the age of micro- and nanotechnology, these rather old-fashioned concepts have gained a wholly new relevance.",1
17,"By a consequent downscaling of the channel dimensions to micrometer dimensions, the reaction volume can be tremendously decreased to the order of a few μL.",1
18,"Additionally, using a proper channel design, there is basically no dead volume (defined as the volume between the point where the reaction is initiated, and the first observation point).",1
19,"There is one significant difference to the standard applications, though: On such small scales, the flow is strictly laminar.",1
20,"The Reynolds ()-number—determined by the quotient of friction to inertial forces, and indicating the transition of laminar to turbulent flow—usually lies between 1 and 10 for typical flow velocities of a few mm s in micrometer-sized channels.",1
21,"This is far below the value of ∼2000 where turbulences and consequently, turbulence-induced mixing, can be expected.",1
22,"Without an elaborate additional instrumentation  modification of the channel walls that supports fast mixing, or electro-kinetic turbulent mixing modules, the starting of reactions is solely based on molecular diffusion within the sample.",1
23,The time that a molecule needs to travel an average distance by diffusion is proportional to the square of the distance.,1
24,"Thus, diffusion-limited mixing can be sped up by miniaturization of the diffusion zone.",1
25,A straightforward way to achieve this was introduced by Knight,1
26,"Here, a fast sheath flow of reactant A from two side channels merges with the flow in a middle channel containing another reactant B, thereby focussing the solution in this central zone down to a thin layer (see also the schematic drawing in Fig. 1, right inset).",3
27,The control parameter in these mixing devices is the ratio of flow rates in the side and main channels.,3
28,The characteristic mixing time for this so-called hydrodynamic focussing depends on the size of the flow layers as well as on the molecular diffusion coefficients of the sample.,3
29,"After initiating the reaction by mixing, a crucial requirement to investigate fast reaction dynamics is a high spatial resolution of the readout process along the channel.",3
30,"In addition, proper readout parameters have to be defined which reliably reflect the reaction progress, and which can be determined with high sensitivity to avoid delays due to signal accumulation.",3
31,"Furthermore, to precisely translate the spatial position of the observation points along the channel to the exact time points of the reaction, the control and knowledge of the flow velocity is indispensable.",3
32,"In this study, hybrid silicon elastomer/glass chips comprising a miniaturized channel system were employed as continuous flow reactors, adapted to a confocal setup for high-resolution optical detection.",10
33,"Both the characteristic properties of the flow system as well as the progress of the reaction, could be simultaneously determined by means of fluorescence spectroscopy with high sensitivity and at low sample concentrations.",0
34,"To precisely control the flow velocity within the sample, spatial fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy was employed.",10
35,This special mode of confocal analysis is performed by creating two slightly displaced laser foci by a single microscope objective.,10
36,Each of these fluorescence excitation volumes is observed independently by a sensitive detector.,10
37,"By proper alignment of the sample flow inside the microfluidic channels, the emission signal from fluorescent molecules that are successively passing both excitation volumes is measured.",10
38,"Cross-correlation analysis of the signals results in a curve with a distinct maximum, corresponding to the average time that a molecule needs to travel the distance between both excitation volumes.",3
39,"Contrary to alternative imaging techniques, dual-beam cross-correlation in a confocal setup allows for very sensitive analysis, and for real-time monitoring of the flow velocity with high spatial resolution.",3
40,This optical setup was modified to observe the progress of the cleavage reaction of a double stranded DNA oligomer by the enzyme exonuclease III  dual-color fluorescence analysis.,9
41,"The complementary DNA strands are labelled with orange fluorescent TAMRA and red fluorescent Cy 5 dye molecules, respectively, promoting an efficient fluorescent resonant energy transfer (FRET) from the donor TAMRA to the acceptor Cy 5 if both strands are annealed and intact.",10
42,"The dual-color fluorescence analysis of the DNA was supported by spectral discrimination of the emission signal in two detection channels, quantifying donor and acceptor emission.",10
43,"During reaction, the enzyme cuts the nucleotides beginning at the 3′ end.",5
44,The spatial separation of the dyes results in the loss of energy transfer.,5
45,"Thus, the decrease of fluorescence intensity in the acceptor detection channel purified of cross-talk from the donor detection channel reports directly the progress of the cleavage reaction.",5
46,"Although standard dual-color cross-correlation in principle allows the direct determination of slow irreversible enzymatic cleavage reactions with reaction rates of a few minutes ( reactions that are clearly slower than the time needed for data acquisition), fast reaction mechanisms could so far not be resolved.",2
47,The introduction of μCF could thus greatly improve the time resolution whithout a significant reduction of detection sensitivity.,4
48,The optical setup based on a dual-beam setup is modified (Fig. 1).,1
49,"The 514 nm line of an Ar-Ion laser (Lasos, Jena, Germany) passes two polarizing beam splitter cubes to create two parallel but slightly displaced laser beams.",10
50,"For equalizing the intensity of both laser beams, a /2-waveplate is used.",10
51,"The beams are coupled into an inverted microscope (Olympus IX 50) and focussed by an objective (Olympus UplanApo 60×, NA1.2) creating two excitation spots ( = 80 kW cm).",3
52,"The fluorescence from each spot is spectrally split by a dichroic mirror (specifications in figure caption, all purchased from AHF, Tübingen, Germany), passes respective band pass filters and is then imaged onto the entrance slits of two fiber bundles serving as confocal pinholes.",10
53,The bundles consist of two separate fibers with distinct aperture distances (200 μm) corresponding to the distance of the focused laser spots.,10
54,"With the objective of 60× magnification, the centres of both laser spots have a distance of 3.3 μm.",10
55,"Each fiber is connected to separate detectors (SPCM CD3017, EG&G).",10
56,"In this way, four detection channels are created, allowing both the determination of  by spatial cross-correlation of signals from the same fiber bundle, and the dual-color fluorescence analysis from the spectrally distinct signals measured by different fiber bundles at the same spatial position.",10
57,"The data acquisition is performed using two correlator cards (ALV Langen, Germany).",3
58,"For calculations and data fitting procedures, Origin software (Microcal) was employed.",3
59,"The optical setup was calibrated by standard autocorrelation analysis of the four detection channels with a tetramethylrhodamine solution (under diffusion condition,  without flow).",10
60,"In the case of optimal adjustment, the four autocorrelation curves match perfectly, indicating the same size of the spectrally and spatially distinct measurement volumes.",10
61,"From the autocorrelation function, the dimensions of the approximately cylindrical detection volume could be determined.",10
62,It has a radius of 0.5 μm and a half length of 2.85 μm (data not shown).,10
63,"Spectra were taken with a fiber optic spectrometer (S2000, Ocean Optics).",3
64,"The microstructured channels are formed in poly(dimethyl)siloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) using a teflon coated silicon wafer as mould (fabricated by GeSim, Großerkmannsdorf, Germany) and cut to a size of ∼2 × 3 cm.",10
65,They are sealed by a coverslip tightly adhering to the silicone rubber.,10
66,The sample supply is facilitated by punched holes.,10
67,The channels are 15 μm high and 25 μm width (narrow section: 6 μm).,10
68,The total length of the observation channel is 10 mm.,10
69,The channels are fabricated freshly before each experiment to minimize contamination by dust.,10
70,"To generally prevent adsorption of protein to the channel walls, a buffer solution containing BSA (1 μg ml) is introduced and incubated for 30 min.",10
71,"To apply flow velocities faster than 2 mm s, the coverslip and the PDMS structure are treated in a plasma cleaner for 5 min and immediately pressed together, so that they form a strong bond.",10
72,The holes at the end of the channels are connected to syringe pumps by tubes.,10
73,"For the continuous flow reaction, double stranded DNA (28 bp) is labelled with Cy5 (Amersham) at the 5′ end of one single strand and carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA, Molecular Probes) at position 14 of the complementary strand.",10
74,"10–30 μl of DNA solution (3.7 nM in 1× NE buffer 1 pH 7, New England Biolabs) is fed into the input reservoir of the middle channel, the side channel reservoirs were filled with the same amount of an exonuclease III solution (New England Biolabs, 15–793 μM in the same buffer solution).",10
75,All experiments are carried out at 21 °C.,10
76,"Mixing is facilitated using a crossed microfluidic channel system, where the DNA substrate is fed into the middle channel and enzyme solution into the side channels.",3
77,"At the intersection, the solutions merge to three parallel fluid layers.",1
78,The thickness of each layer is determined by the flow rates that can be regulated by the hydrodynamic pressures exerted by different heights of the respective liquid reservoirs.,3
79,"For the here described experiments, the flow rates at each entrance channel are identical, which are precisely controlled by measuring the flow velocities  dual-beam cross-correlation (see below).",10
80,The efficient mixing of two different solutions inside the channels is illustrated in Fig. 2.,1
81,The intensity profiles of TAMRA fluorescence perpendicular to the flow direction indicate that the mixing of the DNA solution is started directly at the channel junction.,8
82,"However, to circumvent artifacts arising from non-uniform concentration profiles, a narrowing neck section was introduced in the main channel shortly after the channel junction, resulting in a supplementary narrowing of the parallel flow layers.",10
83,"A complete mixing of both solutions,  an evenly distributed fluorescence intensity, is obtained immediately after passing this neck and thus, the reaction conditions are equalized over the channel cross-section.",8
84,"Considering the measured flow velocities of the solutions, the mixing time can be determined.",6
85,For the here described experiments with typical velocities of max.,5
86,"1.3 mm s, it is approximately 100 ms.",5
87,"By adaptation of self-made tubing connectors and syringe pumps, flow velocities up to ∼50 mm s are accessible.",5
88,"However, for fast flow rates, the concentration profile of sample due to incomplete mixing has to be taken into account.",1
89,"In this context, a further decrease of the channel dimensions that supports faster mixing would be useful.",4
90,We were carrying out the cleavage reaction of a double stranded DNA oligomer (28 bp) by the enzyme exonuclease III that cuts the nucleotides beginning at the 3′ end.,9
91,"The part strands of the DNA oligomer are labelled with carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) and Cy 5, respectively.",10
92,The spectra of the DNA before and after the enzymatic cleavage reaction of the nucleotides are shown in Fig. 3.,8
93,"Assuming a reaction scheme without fluorescent intermediates, the intensity of the Cy 5 fluorescence () can be calculated in the following way: = [DNA] + [DNA]where [DNA] and [DNA] are the concentration of DNA, and  an  are the molecular brightnesses of Cy 5 in the presence and absence of energy transfer,  if Cy 5 is bound to the intact or cleaved DNA strand, respectively.",6
94,"The brightness of Cy 5 in the intact DNA () has a constant value, depending on the energy transfer efficiency from TAMRA to Cy5.",6
95,"After the reaction,  = 0 can be assumed and thus, the concentration of intact DNA is directly proportional to the intensity of Cy 5 fluorescence.",6
96,"Since the applied laser intensity is low, we neglect photobleaching that is generally very weak in flowing systems.",6
97,"For fast and sensitive measurements in the microfluidic channel system, we determined the fluorescence intensity,  the count rate of detected photons, by spectral filtering in two detection channels ( and ), corresponding to donor and acceptor fluorescence.",9
98,For calculation of the “pure” Cy 5 fluorescence intensity () from the experimentally determined signal in the red detection channel it has to be considered that the count rate does not decrease to zero even in the case of completely cleaved DNA.,1
99,"After subtraction of the background mainly due to stray light from the microchannel and the constant direct excitation of Cy 5 at  = 514 nm (summarized in ), the remaining signal is caused by cross talk,  the red fluorescence tail from TAMRA.",5
100,It is determined to be 8.3% of the signal intensity of TAMRA ().,5
101,"Thus  is calculated as follows: =  −  − 0.083 ×  is the signal in the orange detection channel () minus a constant background (): =  −  is normalized by dividing the values by the initial fluorescence intensity (), eliminating variations due to experimental ( pipetting) errors.",6
102,"For the applied laser intensity and the DNA concentration of 3.7 nM, the initial signals of the DNA solution are typically  = 250 kHz and  = 350 kHz.",5
103,"The average background signals were determined for pure buffer solution filled into the microfluidic channels,  = 8.4 kHz and  = 3.4 kHz.",5
104,The red signal due to direct excitation of Cy 5 by  = 514 nm is 50 kHz.,5
105,"After initiating the cleavage reaction inside the microchannel by mixing, the decrease of  is followed at 15 different positions () between 0–6000 μm downstream (Fig. 4, top).",8
106,"A monoexponential decrease of the fluorescence intensity can be observed, in full agreement with the proposed reaction mechanism that a fast steady state formation of the DNA–enzyme complex is followed by a first-order cleavage reaction with the reaction rate  (The index “0” indicates the values at position 0):",4
107,"At high flow rates, the reaction is delayed and deviations from non-exponential behavior are apparent, reflecting the time needed until the complete DNA cleavage can first be detected, as well as non-idealities in mixing.",5
108,"To rule out unspecific removal of educt or product due to adsorption to the channel walls, the microfluidic channels were incubated with BSA buffer.",10
109,"The intensities of orange and red fluorescence (, the concentrations) were checked for a pure intact DNA substrate, as well as for free nucleotides labelled with the respective fluorophores.",9
110,They proved to be constant all along the observed channel length.,5
111,"To determine the exact flow time from the mixing point to the observation point, representing the reaction time, spatial fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy is employed.",0
112,"Here, the flow velocity  is analyzed by cross-correlation of the signals emitted from the two displaced focal spots.",3
113,"By subtraction of the resulting forward and backward cross-correlation curves for the time , the “true” directional cross-correlation signal () exhibits a maximum for the flow time .",6
114,"The flow time correspond to the time that the fluorescent molecules need to travel from the center of the first to the second focal spot, if the flow direction is aligned with the connecting axis of the two foci ( = 0).",6
115,"The flow time  is determined using the following expression:with , the number of particles flowing through  focused spots, and , the average transit time of the molecules through one focal element in the case of pure diffusion.",6
116,and  are the 1/ dimensions of the detection volumes in the radial and axial direction.,6
117,"is the distance of the focal spots (here: 3.3 μm, see experimental section).",6
118,"Hence, the position of the observation point  is translated into the reaction time  as follows:",6
119,"The flow velocity  determined in the center of the channel after mixing of the reactants is varied from 0.3 to 1.3 mm s (flow times between 2.6 and 10.0 ms, Fig. 3).",8
120,"Translating position into time for the results in Fig. 4 (bottom), we determine the reaction rate of the cleavage reaction with  = (0.75 ± 0.04) s.",5
121,It is nicely confirmed for all applied flow velocities.,4
122,"Under saturation conditions, the rate of digestion is about 10 nucleotides per second, since the enzyme has to cut 14 nucleotides (nt) until the energy transfer is eliminated which is in the range of the reaction rates previously measured by Hoheisel (∼1–16 nt s).",5
123,"However, differences in temperature and buffer composition might influence the reaction rates, as well as the low melting temperature of the short DNA double strands, resulting in early strand separation and after cutting just a few (instead of 14) nucleotides.",1
124,"Finally, the reaction is followed for various enzyme concentrations between 15 and 40 μmol l at constant flow velocity of 0.3 mm s.",9
125,We were applying the same analysis as described above.,1
126,The reaction rates obtained (Fig. 5) are—as expected—increasing with increasing enzyme concentration (approximately linear for low concentrations).,8
127,For high enzyme concentration a saturation value of the reaction rate is reached in good agreement with the theoretically expected course (see also ).,5
128,"In this study, a new scheme for the investigation of fast reactions based on confocal fluorescence spectroscopy in a miniaturized continuous flow (μCF) reactor was presented.",9
129,"By dual-beam cross-correlation, the flow velocity inside the microchannel can be comfortably controlled.",3
130,"Simultaneously, the reaction progress was followed by dual-color analysis, and the reaction rate of the DNA cleavage could be determined.",3
131,"To overcome the drawbacks of conventional CF reactors with regard to high sample consumption, self-made microfluidic chips were employed, allowing an economical expenditure of sample solution of a only few μL, while low concentrations (nM) could be used due to the high sensitivity of the detection setup.",3
132,The overall sample consumption thus amounted to only ∼10 mol = 10 fmol which makes the device extremely valuable for studying (biochemical) reactions where the amount of available sample is often very low.,5
133,"A broad temporal range from μs to seconds is accessible, although for fast velocities above 1 mm s the non-uniform concentration profile needs to taken in to account.",5
134,"Due to the sensitivity of the optical setup that supports the detection of single molecules, the concept can be extended to the study individual molecular events, where subpopulations can be resolved and more detailed information of the reaction mechanism be obtained.",4
0,Possible induced enhancement of dispersion forces by cellular phones,7
1,We derive the dispersion forces between objects in the presence of a non-thermal radiation field.,9
2,We apply the formalism to a model system representing two human blood cells in blood.,3
3,"By focusing the same radiation density, as in room-temperature thermal radiation, in the microwave region we find a huge enhancement of the attractive force.",8
4,Related effects are predicted to occur also in other types of biological tissue.,5
5,"The quantitative results should not be taken at face value, since the model is crude.",1
6,"The effects are so large though, that further investigation is motivated.",5
7,The origin of the effects lies in the variation of water and/or ion content.,4
8,"In the microwave region of the spectrum both the dipolar contributions from the water-molecules, and the mobile-ion contributions are important parts of the dielectric function, and cause the enhancement.",4
9,The dispersion forces between two objects can be expressed in terms of the electromagnetic normal modes of the system.,1
10,These forces are van der Waals forces at intermediate separation and Casimir forces at large separations.,1
11,We know how the forces behave at zero and finite temperatures but we do not fully understand the behavior in non-equilibrium situations.,1
12,It is a well-known fact that gradients of optical fields can produce forces on microscopic dielectric objects.,1
13,This effect is utilized in so-called optical tweezers.,1
14,Optical binding between two dielectric objects in the presence of a strong optical field was discussed and demonstrated by Burns,1
15,Other related studies have been performed investigating the van der Waals force involving excited state atoms.,1
16,"The work by Burns  is an example of virtual excitations of the normal modes; the other studies involve real electronic excitations within one of the two interacting objects, not excitations of the normal modes.",1
17,In the present work we study the effects of real excitations of the normal modes of the system.,9
18,Thus the present work complements the previous studies.,1
19,The outline of the article is the following.,1
20,In section II we derive the force between two objects at zero temperature in terms of the electromagnetic normal modes; in this case the modes are not occupied.,3
21,In section III we extend the derivation to finite temperatures where the modes are in equilibrium with the thermal radiation field; in this case the modes are occupied according to the distribution function for mass-less bosons at the given temperature.,3
22,In section IV we use a Lorentzian distribution function.,6
23,In section V we concentrate on spherical objects.,3
24,"In section VI we let the Lorentzian distribution function be peaked in the microwave region and apply the theory to the force between two water drops, between two air bubbles in water and finally between two human blood cells in blood.",6
25,Section VII is a summary and conclusion section.,1
26,"At zero temperature the force, fo(), between two objects as a function of separation, , is given by the derivative of the energy, : where the energy is the sum of the zero-point energies of the modes,",6
27,The modes are of two types: one type is localized to the surfaces of the objects and gives rise to the van der Waals interaction; one type extends between the objects and gives rise to the Casimir interaction (see ).,6
28,In a simple system with a small number of well-defined modes this summation can be performed directly.,6
29,In the general case this is not so.,1
30,Then we can rely on an extension of the so-called argument principle to find the results.,6
31,Let us study a region in the complex frequency plane.,9
32,"We have two functions defined in this region; one, (), is analytic in the whole region; one, (), has poles and zeros inside the region.",6
33,"The following relation holds for an integration path around the region: where  and  are the zeros and poles, respectively, of function ().",6
34,In the argument principle the function  is replaced by unity and the right hand side then equals the number of zeros minus the number of poles for function () inside the integration path.,6
35,"If we choose the function () to be the function in the defining equation for the normal modes of the system,() = 0,the function  () to beand let the contour enclose all the zeros of the function (), eqn. (3) produces the energy of eqn. (2).",6
36,Using this theorem we end up integrating along a closed contour in the complex frequency plane.,5
37,In most cases it is fruitful to choose the contour shown in Fig. 1.,8
38,We have the freedom to multiply the function  () by an arbitrary constant without changing the result on the right hand side of eqn. (3).,6
39,If we choose it carefully we can make the contribution from the curved part of the contour vanish and we are only left with an integration along the imaginary frequency axis: where the last line was obtained from an integration by parts.,6
40,This needs some clarification.,1
41,The function () contains polarizabilities or other time-correlation functions representing the response of the system one is treating.,6
42,These functions approach zero as the argument goes towards infinity since there is an upper limit for the frequency the system can respond to.,5
43,Consequently () approaches a constant and after we have rescaled the function it approaches unity and the value of the logarithm approaches zero.,5
44,One further property of () we should mention is that on the imaginary axis it is an even function of its argument; this is a general property of the time-correlation functions contained in ().,6
45,We will refer to this property below.,1
46,"The contribution to the internal energy from the interaction between two objects separated by the distance  can in general be written as:where the index  runs over all electromagnetic modes of the system and  and  are the occupation number and energy, respectively, of the mode number .",6
47,Let us now concentrate on one of the modes and omit the indexNote that the occupation number () is a function of energy or frequency and becomes a function of  because the mode energy depends on .,6
48,An infinitesimal change in  modifies  both because of the change in mode energy and because of the change in occupation number The first term is due to mechanical work and the second to heat exchange with the surroundings.,6
49,The free energy  =  −  is the quantity that determines the force.,6
50,Let us now determine  and  where on the last line we have omitted the constant.,6
51,The energy functions are relative to some arbitrary reference level.,6
52,We usually choose this to be the value at infinite separation.,6
53,Thus the free energy is where on the last line we have identified the result as the Helmholtz free energy.,6
54,The force is,6
55,This was the contribution from one of the modes.,6
56,The total contribution to the Helmholtz free energy is We make the observation that we may use the argument principle but now with ln[2sinh(/2)]/ instead of /2 for () in the integrand.,6
57,There is however one complication.,1
58,This new function has poles of its own in the complex frequency plane.,6
59,We have to choose our contour so that it includes all poles and zeros of the function () but excludes those of ().,6
60,The poles of function () all are on the imaginary frequency axis.,6
61,"We use the same contour as in Fig. 1., but now let the straight part of the contour lie just to the right of, and infinitesimally close to, the imaginary axis.",6
62,We have The coth function has poles on the imaginary -axis and they should not be inside the contour.,6
63,"The poles are at and all residues are the same, equal to 2/.",6
64,We integrate along the imaginary axis and deform the path along small semicircles around each pole.,6
65,The integration path is illustrated in Fig. 2.,8
66,The integration along the axis results in zero since the integrand is odd with respect to .,6
67,The only surviving contributions are the ones from the small semicircles.,8
68,The result is Since the summand is even in  (see comment at the end of Section II) we can write this as where the prime on the summation sign indicates that the  = 0 term should be multiplied by a factor of one half.,5
69,This factor of one half is because there is only one term with || = 0 in the original summation but two for all other integers.,5
70,"When the temperature goes to zero the spacing between the discrete frequencies goes to zero and the summation may be replaced by an integration: and we regain the contribution to the internal energy from the interactions, the change in zero-point energy of the modes, as given in eqn. (6).",6
71,In the absence of thermal equilibrium the occupation numbers are different from the Bose–Einstein ones for mass-less bosons and the summation along the imaginary frequency axis will no longer be the same.,1
72,The summation points came from the poles of the distribution function.,1
73,We want a narrow distribution function that is peaked in the microwave region of the spectrum where the cellular phones operate.,0
74,We want a distribution function that is peaked in a narrow energy range and has poles that give rise to feasible calculations.,0
75,A Gaussian distribution function would seem like a good candidate but it does not fulfil these criteria; it has an infinite number of poles on the imaginary axis.,1
76,We instead choose a Lorentzian distribution function.,3
77,Let us now specify our choice of (): () = i[( −  + i) − ( −  − i) + ( +  + i) − ( +  − i)]This function is real-valued on the real frequency axis and is a sum of two Lorentzian functions.,6
78,This function has the proper analytic properties and symmetries of a distribution function.,6
79,The energy or frequency where the distribution is focused is given by  and the width of the distribution by .,6
80,The function has two poles in the right half plane; it is an even analytic function on the imaginary frequency axis.,6
81,"Our integration contour will now consist of the contour in Fig. 1., and two small circles clockwise around the two poles of the distribution function.",6
82,The integrand will be derived next.,9
83,"Using eqns. (7), (10) and (11) gives",6
84,We first assume that we have an explicit expression for the second term of the free energy:,6
85,"Then we may write: and we may use the argument principle again and get one contribution from the integration along the contour of Fig. 1. and one from the contribution of the small circles around the poles of the distribution function: () = () + (), and () = i[ln ( − i) − ln ( + i)]Thus in eqn. (24) we have a similar expression to that for the equilibrium case for  = 0 in eqn. (6), but now with a factor  + 1/2 instead of just 1/2.",6
86,Note that the occupation number is evaluated on the imaginary frequency axis.,8
87,We will now limit the treatment to the interaction between two spherical objects at large and intermediate separations where the dipole-dipole interaction is dominant.,9
88,We limit the treatment to the van der Waals region.,3
89,Then the mode defining function is (see )() = [1 − ()()/][1 − 4()()/]and the free energy is,6
90,In eqns. (27) and (28) we have expanded the logarithm for small arguments.,6
91,"Now the polarizability for the spherical object  in some ambient medium, a, is where  is the radius of the object and () the dielectric function of the ambient medium.",6
92,We now apply the theory to some systems where the objects have a water content differing from that of the ambient medium.,9
93,Water is strongly active in the microwave region due to the permanent dipole moments of the water molecule.,1
94,This property is the basis of the microwave oven.,1
95,The field induces rotations of the molecules.,1
96,"The rotational energy is transformed into heat, due to the internal friction of water.",1
97,"We study two water drops, two air bubbles in water, and two blood cells in blood.",9
98,The dielectric properties of water have been studied extensively and are available in the literature.,1
99,We need these data both on the imaginary frequency axis for eqn. (27) and at general points of the complex frequency plane for eqn. (28).,3
100,The measured values are of course on the real frequency axis.,3
101,"The values on the imaginary axis can be obtained from the knowledge of the imaginary part, () on the real frequency axis from a generalization of the Kramers–Kronig dispersion relations, derived from general properties of analytical functions.",6
102,"The relation is For a general point,  =  + i, in the complex frequency plane the relations for the real part  () and imaginary part, (), are",6
103,In the case of water drops the dielectric function for the ambient medium in eqn. (29) is unity and () is the dielectric function of water.,6
104,Note that the index  here runs over the two drops and does not represent real and imaginary parts.,6
105,In the case of air bubbles in water the ambient dielectric function is that of water and () is unity.,6
106,The results for two water drops are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding results for two bubbles in water are shown in Fig. 4.,8
107,In this work the main objective is the force between two human red blood cells in blood.,0
108,"To be able to perform a reliable, quantitative, calculation of the effects on the force between objects one needs to know the dielectric function in the full spectral range, both for the objects and for the ambient medium.",1
109,Since the information we have is limited we are restricted to rather crude model calculations.,1
110,The dielectric properties of blood in the range of 10 Hz to 100 GHz are known.,1
111,"The data for red blood cells are sparser, though.",1
112,We model the cell as a spherical object of radius  enclosed by a membrane; the radius of a human red blood cell is 4.5 μm and the thickness of the cell membrane is 8 nm.,6
113,We assume that the membrane has the same dielectric parameters as the cell membrane of a white blood cell of B-type.,6
114,"The interior is treated as homogeneous and we adjust the water and ion content of the cytoplasm so that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function for the cell agree with the few available, measured values; we end up with a water content of 75% and obtain the value 0.525 S m for the conductivity from the ions; these values seem reasonable.",5
115,We should be more specific with the dielectric functions used for the blood and blood cells.,4
116,For the blood we use the expression in eqn. (4) of .,3
117,It is valid for frequencies up to 100 GHz and consists of four terms; the first is the high-frequency asymptote; the second is the rotational contribution from water molecules; the third is the rotational contribution from larger entities; the fourth is the contribution from all mobile ions.,6
118,The authors of  adjusted the eight parameters to give a good fit to the experimental data.,1
119,The red blood cell consists of a membrane enclosing the cytoplasm.,1
120,We thus need the dielectric properties of these two materials.,1
121,"Here we use just two of the terms discussed above, the first and the fourth, just as in eqn. (3) of  with parameter values given in that reference.",3
122,"For the cytoplasm we keep in principle the first, second and fourth terms.",6
123,"The two first terms we replace by 1 + [() − 1], where  is the fraction of water and () is the dielectric function of water.",6
124,"This gives us two parameters to vary, ,  and the parameter of the fourth term of the dielectric function, the static conductivity of the mobile ions.",6
125,"The effective dielectric function of the blood cell we determine along the lines of eqns. (4)–(6) of , where we remove the effects from the nucleus.",3
126,The red blood cells have no nucleus.,1
127,"We then vary the two parameters, to get a good fit to the experimental imaginary and real parts of the dielectric function of a red blood cell.",6
128,The fit is seen in Fig. 5.,8
129,"We have probably got good enough estimates of the dielectric properties of blood and cells for the spectral range up to 100 GHz, but we need the properties also for higher frequencies.",2
130,We lack this information.,2
131,We know the dielectric function of water in the whole spectral range.,1
132,The most characteristic feature of this dielectric function is the large contribution from Debye rotational relaxation in the microwave region.,1
133,We model the dielectric function of the cell and of blood by letting them be equal to the function for water for high frequencies.,3
134,The functions used are displayed in Fig. 5.,8
135,"The solid, dashed and dotted curves are the imaginary parts of the dielectric function for the cell, for blood and for water, respectively.",8
136,The circles are the experimental values for the cell from .,1
137,"The short piece of solid curve is our real part of the dielectric function for the cell compared to the experimental values from , indicated by the squares.",8
138,The energy density at the surface of a black-body radiator at 300 K is approximately 6 × 10 J m.,5
139,The corresponding radiative power is 46 mW cm.,5
140,We choose a Lorentzian function peaked at the photon energy 3.5 × 10 eV and with a FWHM of 5% of the peak energy.,3
141,The results are found to be insensitive to the peak width.,5
142,We have let the strength of the distribution be such that the energy density in the radiation field is 1 × 10 J m.,3
143,The corresponding radiative power is 7.5 mW cm.,5
144,Thus we have chosen a slightly weaker radiation than that of the black-body radiator.,1
145,"The numerical values used for ,  and  are 5.32 × 10 s, 1.33 × 10 s and 2.95 × 10 s, respectively.",5
146,"In Fig. 6 we show the result, the upper solid curve, for the interaction potential in the microwave field.",8
147,"For comparison we have included the room temperature result, middle curve, and one in the absence of radiation, lower curve.",8
148,To give the reader a feeling for the strength of the potential we have added two reference potentials: The first is the dash-dotted curve.,8
149,"It is the unscreened potential between two unit charges; in a colloid the particles become charged and typically attain a charge of the order of 100 unit charges, but the resulting repulsive potential between the particles becomes screened by the counterions in the solution and the net potential is strongly reduced and also short range.",5
150,"Thus, a comparison between the repulsive Coulomb potential and the attractive dispersion potential, induced by the microwave field, should be made towards the left in the figure.",8
151,The second reference potential is the short horizontal line in the figure.,8
152,It represents the energy 6 for room temperature.,5
153,This number is an estimate used to determine if a potential barrier is large enough to prevent the particles from overcoming it through the Brownian motion.,5
154,The force between the cells is obtained by taking the derivative of the potential with respect to separation.,3
155,Doing this we find that the force ranges from 0.15 μN at the small-separation end of the figure to 1.5 zN at the large-separation end.,5
156,The potential and force resulting from the microwave radiation can not be considered negligible in comparison with other forces experienced by the blood cells.,4
157,The lowest curve in the figure is the result without radiation.,8
158,This potential comes entirely from the zero-point energy of the normal modes.,5
159,It is only of academic interest since it corresponds to absolute zero temperature.,1
160,The thermal radiation enhances the interaction.,1
161,At room temperature the radiation causes an enhancement of the potential and force at intermediate separations of several orders of magnitude.,5
162,The enhancement at microwave radiation is much more impressive.,8
163,It gives an additional enhancement of ten orders of magnitude.,5
164,The photon energy where the microwave radiation is concentrated is indicated by a bar at the bottom of Fig. 5.,8
165,We see that the energy or frequency is here low enough for the mobile ions to contribute to the screening.,5
166,The ion contribution is of the Drude-tail type and varies as .,8
167,The enhancement of the force in the microwave region is probably due to both ion contributions and contributions from rotations of the water molecules.,5
168,In the calculations for water drops and for bubbles in water we found strong enhancement of the force but not as strong as the result in Fig. 6.,5
169,In these two cases the ion contributions are absent but the rotational contributions are stronger and there are contributions from the whole spectral range including the infrared and ultraviolet regions.,5
170,"To summarize, we have gone beyond the approximation of treating cellular phones as black-body radiators, which is usually done in setting the radiation standards.",9
171,We have focused the radiation power to a peak in the microwave region.,3
172,We have studied the effect of this radiation on the attractive part of the force between two blood cells in blood using a simplified model for the dielectric properties of the system.,9
173,We found an enhancement of the force by ten orders of magnitude when changing the radiation spectrum from thermal to one that is peaked in the microwave region.,5
174,Since the results depend on the water and ion content in the blood and blood cells and since these vary between individuals and also depend on the person's health status the effects can vary from person to person.,4
175,Another possible result from the radiation could be that thin blood vessels contract and thereby limit the flow of blood through them; the surface energy of the blood vessel might increase drastically making a contraction energetically favorable.,4
176,"Still other unwanted effects could be growth of precipitates in tissue and organs, in the eye for example.",4
177,At this stage it is only speculation.,4
178,A word of caution: The present work should not be considered as a proof of that cellular phones are harmful.,1
179,It shows that there may be effects not considered before.,1
180,The weakness of the model calculations lies in the incomplete input data for the dielectric properties of biological tissue and in the description of the radiation field.,5
181,We have not taken into account that the field may be polarized; in a polarized field the forces between the two cells also depend on their relative orientation with respect to the polarization direction; the force may be repulsive for some orientations and even more strongly attractive for others.,1
182,"In general, the force induced by a radiation field has attractive and repulsive contributions from different parts of the spectral range.",1
183,"The origin of the enhancement, we have found, for the interaction between the cells is that the energy density in the radiation field has been concentrated in a spectral range where the contributions are attractive.",5
184,The result is not sensitive to the particular choice of distribution as long as it is peaked at the same spectral position.,5
185,"We have used a Lorentzian distribution function because it has only two poles in the right half of the complex frequency plane, giving rise to the two terms in eqn. (28).",3
186,The Bose–Einstein distribution function for thermal radiation has an infinite number of poles giving rise to the infinite number of terms in eqn. (17).,3
187,Had we used a Gaussian distribution function we would also have ended up with an infinite number of terms.,1
188,The final result would have been similar but the mathematics more cumbersome and the treatment less transparent.,1
189,"Hopefully this study will stimulate efforts to measure the dielectric properties of all components in biological tissue over the full spectral range, making more realistic studies feasible.",4
0,Promotion of reduction in CeZrO: the pyrochlore structure as effect rather than cause?,7
1,Evidence is presented that the well-established phenomenon of promotion of CeZrO reduction by suitable treatment procedures may be controlled by adjusting the conditions; and that such reduction leads to the formation of the pyrochlore structure at extremely low temperature.,5
2,"The redox properties of ceria–zirconia mixed oxides (CZMOs) have been extensively investigated due to their use in automotive three-way catalysts (TWCs), in which CZMOs are included as the oxygen storage component.",1
3,"Correlation between structure and ease of reduction, which has received particular interest, remains an open question.",2
4,"The CeZrO phase diagram may be summarised as follows: for  ≤ 0.15 a cubic, fluorite-type phase is formed, while for  ≥ 0.85, a monoclinic phase is present.",1
5,"At intermediate compositions, various phases (t, t′, t″, κ and t*) have been identified.",1
6,"Oxygen deficient structures, such as the pyrochlore structure (ABX), may also be formed.",1
7,"This is an ordered defect structure, related to that of fluorite, with ⅛ of the anions missing.",1
8,"In practice, pyrochlores are often not stoichiometric and are more correctly represented as ABX.",1
9,Current interest in the pyrochlore structure in CZMOs is strong as its formation has been suggested to enhance oxygen storage behaviour.,2
10,"For CZMOs, they are generally reported to form under severe reducing conditions.",1
11,"Here, we report evidence for the formation of a pyrochlore for CeZrO during low temperature reduction of the sample.",9
12,"CeZrO, BET surface area 40 m g after calcination at 773 K (5 h), was prepared by a previously reported citrate route.",10
13,An  cleaning procedure (CP) was applied before each set of experiments.,10
14,"Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles (25 mg of sample) were recorded in a system equipped with a thermal conductivity detector: CP-O at 773 K (1 h), then cool, first to 423 K in O, then to room temperature (rt) in Ar; TPR-H (10 or 1%) in Ar at rt (30 min), ramp to 1173 or 1273 K, hold 15 min, switch to Ar (15 min).",10
15,"TPR profiles are designated as severe reduction (SR) procedures; after TPR, cool to 700 K and oxidise (mild oxidation—MO) in O (1 h), or oxidise at 1173 or 1273 K (severe oxidation—SO).",10
16,"O was pulsed in all cases (100 µl, every 75 s).",10
17,Flow and ramp rates: 25 ml min and 10 K min respectively.,10
18,Powder XRD spectra were collected on a Siemens Kristalloflex Mod.F (Ni-filtered Cu Kα).,3
19,"TPR-Raman spectra were obtained on a Renishaw Raman System 1000, with an Ar laser (514 nm, 25 mW) fitted with an  cell that allows control of temperature and gas flow.",3
20,"Reduction was performed by introducing the reducing gas (1 or 10% H in Ar), heating in a stepwise manner (50 K intervals) and recording the spectra during the isothermal steps (15 min).",10
21,Oxidation was performed in the same cell at the same temperatures as for TPR experiments.,10
22,It is known that the temperature at which CZMOs release oxygen under reducing conditions may be decreased or increased upon application of SR/MO or SO treatment regimes.,1
23,"This effect is reported in Fig. 1, which shows a series of TPR profiles obtained using 10 and 1% H.",8
24,SR and SO were conducted at both 1173 K (A) and 1273 K (B).,10
25,"Due to the different response to 1 and 10% H, the profiles shown have been normalised to the total area detected.",6
26,"Profiles A1, A2, B1 and B2 were obtained after: SR–MO–SR–SO.",3
27,"All show H uptake at relatively high temperature, the maximum of which depends on H concentration.",5
28,The latter is an established TPR phenomenon.,1
29,"After intermediate MO procedures, further TPR profiles (A1′, A2′, B1′ and B2′) were recorded.",3
30,"The most striking feature of this data set is that, for SR and SO at 1173 K (A), the procedure followed results in low temperature reduction with 10% H but not with 1% H.",8
31,It should be noted that the profile always remains on-scale with 1% H.,5
32,"Thus, reduction is not limited by H concentration.",5
33,"For SR and SO at 1273 K (B), low temperature reduction is observed with both H concentrations, but the effect is more pronounced with 10% H, in the sense that the relative intensities of the two peaks observed indicate more uptake in the low temperature feature.",5
34,Cycling between the related profiles in Fig. 1B may be achieved by further SO and SR–MO treatments.,8
35,"Thus, aspects of the behaviour reported in Fig. 1 are consistent with previous observations.",4
36,"However, here we show that the effect is also strongly dependent on H concentration and temperature, in addition to the known dependence on the oxidation conditions (SO  MO).",4
37,Rietveld analysis of the XRD profile after SO at 1173 and 1273 K initially indicated that the structure may be fitted equally well using cubic (3) or tetragonal (4/) models.,8
38,Careful collection of XRD data revealed the presence of a low intensity characteristic t′ reflection (2 = 42°).,8
39,"Similar analysis after subsequent SR (corresponding to 1A2 and 1B1)–MO showed only a small cell volume decrease from the SO-treated samples, suggesting that the procedures do not induce significant changes in the cation sub-lattice, at least on the XRD scale of detection (see ESI).",5
40,Fig. 2 shows two series of  TPR-Raman spectra obtained during reduction of CeZrO using 1% H (A) and 10% H (B).,8
41,These Raman spectra offer a representative study of the TPR profiles A2′ and B1′ shown in Fig. 1.,8
42,"In both cases, there was negligible change in the position and a small decrease in intensity of the peaks between rt and 473 K (first spectra shown).",8
43,"It is important to underline the possibility of superimposed luminescence signals, derived from rare earth impurities at ppm levels, in these spectra.",5
44,"The intensity of such peaks strongly depends on factors such as temperature and environment, so great care must be taken when comparing spectra for structural analysis.",1
45,"For the sample treated to 1173 K in 1% H (Fig. 2A), the first spectrum shows peaks at 225, 306, 470, and 623 cm which are consistent with the presence of a t′ phase.",5
46,"As the reduction temperature increases, the peak intensities decrease, until, at temperatures corresponding to complete reduction of the sample (Fig. 1A2′), a featureless spectrum is observed.",5
47,"No Raman features could be observed at 1173 K and above due to the blackbody radiation, which overwhelms the Raman signal.",5
48,"In the case of the sample treated to 1273 K in 10% H, the first spectrum shows peaks at 184, 301, 470, 540 and 623 cm, which are also consistent with the presence of a t′ phase.",5
49,"Between 523 and 573 K, after commencement of sample reduction (Fig. 1B1′), peak intensities decrease strongly.",8
50,"At 623 K a weak peak appears at 295 cm, which becomes more intense and shifts to lower wavenumber as the temperature increases, while others appear at 380 and 495 cm.",8
51,These peaks are consistent with the formation of a pyrochlore phase.,4
52,"It is clear that the temperature at which the pyrochlore structure becomes visible (673 K, Fig. 2) is well above the start of the reduction profile (<500 K, Fig. 1B1′).",8
53,"The difference in experimental procedure (ramped  stepped temperature increase) should mean that, at a given temperature, the sample is more reduced during TPR-Raman than during TPR.",7
54,"Finally, after a TPR-Raman series corresponding to Fig 1B1, the sample was cooled to 700 K and spectra were measured before and after oxidation.",9
55,"No evidence of the pyrochlore or related structures was found, indicating that the pyrochlore was not formed at high temperature during the previous TPR.",5
56,The metastable nature of CZMOs with intermediate compositions has created difficulty in establishing certainties about the structure of such materials; which has generally complicated structural analysis of TPR behaviour.,1
57,"Despite this, the observation of promoted TPR profiles has recently been linked to a newly reported κ phase, formed by oxidation (873 K) of CeZrO with the pyrochlore structure and destroyed by high temperature oxidation (1323 or 1423 K) to yield another new phase (t*).",1
58,The pyrochlore was initially formed by high temperature reduction of a t′ phase.,1
59,Here we present evidence of formation of the pyrochlore phase .,9
60,"Clearly, the preceding treatments have already conferred upon the sample the potential to undergo low temperature reduction, which in turn leads to very low temperature pyrochlore formation.",4
61,"Neither effect is observed with 1% H, SR and SO 1173 K, thereby implying a link between promoted reduction and low temperature pyrochlore formation.",4
62,"Table 1 reports the degree of reduction for the eight TPR profiles of Fig. 1, as measured by O uptake during MO.",8
63,Comparable and high degrees of reduction were achieved in all experiments suggesting that formation of pyrochlore should be equally favoured.,5
64,"Despite this, pyrochloric structure was observed only in Fig. 2B, corresponding to TPR profile B1′, thereby indicating that extent of reduction is not directly responsible for pyrochlore formation.",4
65,"Finally, the Raman spectra recorded after the CP, in Fig. 2 and at the start of TPR profile B1 (not shown) may all be assigned to t′.",5
66,"We find no clear correlation between the appearance of the Raman spectra and reduction profile (or formation of pyrochlore), although it must be reiterated that the possible presence of impurity peaks makes identification of any such correlation difficult.",4
67,"Instead, we believe that a more complex situation than a simple structure–TPR relationship may be inferred for the TPR behaviour of this sample.",4
68,The formation of surface domains which promote reduction of the sample could instead offer an explanation.,7
69,The kinetics of the pyrochlore formation at high temperature has not been carefully studied.,1
70,"Therefore, as suggested by an anonymous referee, it cannot be excluded that the pyrochlore nucleation process occurs in high temperature conditions (its rate being increased by increasing hydrogen pressure), while the growth process could occur with a significant rate at moderate temperatures.",4
71,"Once formed superficially at high temperature, a very thin pyrochlore layer (the nuclei) could be transformed into the κ phase under mild conditions, which in turn gives the pyrochlore structure (as in Fig. 2b) at low temperature, first on the surface then inwards of the particle (growth process).",4
72,Such a process would be difficult to observe given the detection limits of the techniques employed here.,1
73,"In addition, the existence of antiphase domain boundaries may further weaken the XRD peaks due to the κ phase.",1
74,"On the other hand while the Raman technique proved to be sensitive in detecting the κ phase, no evidence for its presence was observed here.",4
75,Further studies are in progress in order to ascertain these aspects.,1
76,"Consistent with the suggestion of the importance of surface modifications, studies carried out on the present sample indicated that the scrambling capacity between D and surface hydroxyl groups is affected by the redox treatments.",5
77,"In summary, formation of a  pyrochloric structure,  an ordered system, is not a necessary prerequisite to achieve promoted redox properties in CeZrO.",4
0,Hydrogen diffusion effects on the kinetics of the hydrogen electrode reactionPart II. Evaluation of kinetic parameters,9
1,The present work proposes a methodology for the evaluation of the kinetic parameters of the hydrogen electrode reaction for the Tafel–Heyrovsky–Volmer mechanism from experimental results corresponding to the study of the hydrogen oxidation on a rotating disc electrode.,9
2,"It is based on the correlation of the experimental dependence () with a theoretical expression together with some constraints that involve the use of the equilibrium polarisation resistance, which reduces the number of adjustable parameters.",6
3,"This methodology was applied to the hydrogen oxidation reaction on a platinum electrode, which was studied in the range 900 ≤ /rpm ≤ 8100 and −0.05 ≤ /V ≤ 0.40 in 0.5 M HSO.",10
4,The results obtained have been discussed in the light of the theoretical treatment described in Part I of this work.,1
0,Non-photochemical spectral hole-burning mediated by water molecules in interligand pockets of [Cr(terpy)],9
1,"Low temperature fluorescence line-narrowing (FLN) and spectral hole-burning experiments (SHB) were performed in the E←A spin–flip transition of [Cr(2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine)] in frozen ethylene glycol/water (2 ∶ 1) and DMSO/water (2 ∶ 1) glasses.",3
2,In the FLN experiments an average E splitting of 23 cm is observed.,5
3,It is concluded that the interaction with water molecules in pockets provided by the ligands is most likely to be responsible for the relatively efficient non-photochemical hole-burning.,4
4,Fast spectral diffusion and spontaneous hole-filling prevent the observation of holes above 20 K. The FLN and SHB experiments were performed by using a diode laser.,4
5,Electronic transitions are inhomogeneously broadened in condensed phases due to the variation of local fields.,1
6,This broadening obscures valuable spectroscopic information at low temperatures.,1
7,Often it can be overcome by the application of laser techniques such as fluorescence line narrowing (FLN) and spectral hole-burning (SHB).,3
8,Laser techniques facilitate investigations of subtle details of the electronic structure of molecules or molecular ions.,1
9,Non-photochemical spectral hole-burning is a general phenomenon in amorphous systems.,1
10,"It is based on some rearrangement of host–guest interactions upon photoexcitation, resulting in a slight shift of the transition frequency of the laser-selected subset of chromophores.",1
11,"Recently, metal complexes of the 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine ligand (abbreviated as terpy in the following) and its derivatives have obtained a great deal of attention.",1
12,"The [Cr(terpy)] complex displays a very strong nephelauxetic effect in comparison with very similar systems such as [Cr(bpy)] (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine).",1
13,This follows from the 760 cm shift of the  lines from ≈729 nm for [Cr(bpy)] to 772 nm for [Cr(terpy)].,1
14,"The latter complex assumes a distorted meridional geometry, resulting in interligand pockets which facilitate a solvation of the chromium(iii) ion.",1
15,Efficient non-photochemical hole-burning processes can be expected due to the interaction of the solvent molecules with the terpy ligands.,1
16,"Terpy, like bpy, can stabilise the +2 oxidation state of chromium and hence its complexes have some potential as optical recording materials.",2
17,Here we present preliminary results of fluorescence line-narrowing (FLN) and spectral hole-burning (SHB) studies of the E←A spin–flip transition in [Cr(terpy)].,9
18,"2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (terpy) was used as obtained from Aldrich.",10
19,[Cr(terpy)](PF) was synthesised from CrCl·6HO and terpy following modified literature procedures.,10
20,"CrCl·6HO was treated with zinc amalgam to form a solution of Cr(ii), and a portion of this solution was added to a deoxygenated solution of terpy in methanol.",10
21,"The resulting red–brown [Cr(terpy)] solution was bubbled through with oxygen to produce yellow [Cr(terpy)], which was then isolated as the hexafluorophosphate salt by treatment with NaPF(aq).",10
22,The chromium(iii) concentration in the ethylene glycol/water (2 ∶ 1) and DMSO/water (2 ∶ 1) glasses was ≈ 0.005 M. The samples were cooled to 2.5 K by a closed-cycle refrigerator (Janis/Sumitomo SHI-4.5).,10
23,Non-selective luminescence spectra were excited by the 488-nm line of an Ar laser (Spectra Physics Stabilite 2017).,10
24,The luminescence was dispersed by a Spex 1704 monochromator (1200 grooves mm holographic grating) and detected by a cooled RCA31034 photomultiplier.,10
25,After current–voltage conversion by a broadband preamplifier (Products-For-Research) the signal was processed by a lock-in-amplifier (EG&G 5210).,10
26,The FLN spectra were excited by a current- and temperature-stabilised (Thorlabs LDC500 and TEC2000 controllers with TCLDM9 thermoelectric mounts) single frequency laser diode (Sharp LT025MD0).,10
27,Two frequency and phase locked optical choppers (Thorlabs MC1000) with custom-made blades) were used in tandem with a phase shift of 180° for the resonant FLN experiments.,10
28,The first chopper employed a blade with a duty cycle of about 20% to modulate the laser and the second chopper was used at the entrance slit of the monochromator.,10
29,This experimental arrangement prevents laser light from entering the monochromator.,10
30,In the hole-burning spectra the wavelength of the laser was kept constant for the burn period and subsequently scanned by modulating the current (triangle ramp).,10
31,The hole-burning spectra were measured in excitation and the monochromator was used in zeroth order with a RG715 filter.,10
32,"To reject laser light, the tandem chopper configuration (see above) was employed.",10
33,In the hole-burning spectra the output of the lock-in amplifier was averaged by a digital storage oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS210).,10
34,The laser scans were calibrated by a spectrum analyser (Coherent model 240) with a free spectral range of 1.5 GHz.,10
35,Fig. 1 shows the non-selectively excited luminescence spectra of [Cr(terpy)] in ethylene glycol/water (2 ∶ 1) and DMSO/water (2 ∶ 1) at 2.5 K in comparison with the resonantly narrowed luminescence spectrum in the DMSO/water (2 ∶ 1) glass at 20 K.,8
36,The FLN spectrum was measured at 20 K to avoid hole-burning.,10
37,The A←E emission is strongly red-shifted in [Cr(terpy)] due to a pronounced nephelauxetic effect (reduction of the Racah  parameter caused by electron delocalisation onto the ligands) and peaks at ≈772 nm.,5
38,The inhomogeneous linewidth of the electronic origin () is ≈90 cm in both systems.,5
39,This is comparable to the value reported for [Cr(bpy)].,8
40,"In the FLN spectrum well defined vibrational sidelines are observed at –121, −206, −327, −209 and −455 cm.",8
41,The laser predominantly excites chromophores  the  line.,1
42,"However, some molecular cations get excited  the  line.",1
43,This leads to relatively broad -emission at longer wavelength (see inset of Fig. 1) since molecules excited into the  line will relax to  and energy levels of transition metal complexes in amorphous hosts are poorly correlated (the E splitting varies within the inhomogeneous distribution).,5
44,Note that the resonant line in the inset of Fig. 1 is truncated.,8
45,The average E splitting is ≈ 23 cm with a standard deviation of ≈ 15 cm.,5
46,Thus the E splitting is better defined than in [Cr(bpy)].,5
47,We partly assign this difference to the nominal  symmetry of the [Cr(terpy)] complex but particularly to the higher rigidity of terpy compared to bpy.,4
48,We have found that the E splitting in trigonal complexes may vary drastically in amorphous systems due to low symmetry perturbations.,4
49,At 2.5 K the excited state lifetime is 584 ± 1 µs in the ethylene glycol/water glass and 694 ± 1 µs in nafion.,5
50,This indicates that solvent molecules are present in the interligand pockets providing an efficient pathway for the non-radiative deactivation of the E state by direct energy transfer to high frequency acceptor modes.,4
51,It is important to realize that this electronic to vibrational energy transfer is facilitated by the coincidence of the luminescence of [Cr(terpy)] with the absorption spectrum of the fourth overtones of O–H and C–H stretch frequencies.,4
52,Fig. 2 presents a ≈30% deep spectral hole burnt into the E←A transition of [Cr(terpy)] in ethylene glycol/water (2 ∶ 1).,8
53,The initial hole-burning efficiency is estimated to be ≈0.3%.,5
54,We tentatively assign this  efficient hole-burning process to rearrangements of solvent molecules in the interligand pockets.,4
55,The holewidth is strongly dependent on the hole depth.,8
56,"For example, a 10% deep hole has a width of 400 MHz compared to the 780-MHz width of the 30% hole.",5
57,Taking into account the 70-MHz laser linewidth an upper limit of an effective homogeneous linewidth  of 130 MHz results by using eqn. (1). = 2 + 2This is orders of magnitude larger than the lifetime-limited linewidth of  = 1/2π ( is the excited state lifetime).,5
58,"Fast spectral diffusion caused by rearrangements of host–guest interactions, and electronic and nuclear spin fluctuations must be responsible for the observed holewidth.",4
59,"For example, the  electronic spin–spin interactions may contribute significantly to the holewidth for the concentration used in the present experiment.",4
60,"Furthermore, superhyperfine interactions with the proton spins of the water molecules in the interligand pockets provides another mechanism for the broadening.",4
61,Sample heating can be excluded since the optical density at the laser frequency is very low (<0.001) and relatively low laser powers were used.,1
62,Relatively fast spontaneous hole-filling occurs.,5
63,"For example, the hole area of an initially 20% deep spectral hole decreases by 30% in 500 s.",5
64,Spectral holes cannot be burnt at temperatures above 20 K. These observations are indicative of a non-photochemical hole-burning mechanism and two-level systems with relatively low activation barriers enabling fast spontaneous hole-filling at higher temperatures.,5
65,If deep spectral holes in the [Cr(terpy)]/ethylene glycol/water system are cycled from 2.5 to 20 to 2.5 K over 10 minutes a significant increase of the holewidth is observed (0.8 to 2.55 GHz).,8
66,This is a direct indication of thermally activated spectral diffusion by the dynamic rearrangement of host–guest interactions.,4
67,It has been suggested that in frozen solutions the parameters  and  of the spin Hamiltonian of the A ground state are subject to a statistical distribution caused by the solvent molecules in the interligand pockets.,1
68,"This idea is supported by the present SHB experiments: no distinct sideholes are measurable in the range of the reported zero field splitting, 0.28–0.34 cm, of [Co(terpy)](ClO)·2.5HO ∶ Cr(iii).",4
69,We have applied an inexpensive laser diode in FLN and SHB studies of a coordination compound in an amorphous host.,9
70,The [Cr(terpy)] system shows a relatively high efficiency of the non-photochemical hole-burning process.,5
71,We  assign this to  Further investigations of the solvent–ligand interactions by laser techniques and deuteration effects are currently undertaken.,4
